TypeScript 3.0 is out! It comes with enhancements for the type system, compiler, and language service. This release is shipping with the following:

- **Project references** let TypeScript projects depend on other TypeScript projects by allowing `tsconfig.json` files to reference other `tsconfig.json` files.

- Support for `defaultProps` in JSX.

- Tuples in rest parameters and spread expressions with optional elements.

- **New** `unknown` top type! It's the type-safe counterpart of `any`.

For this blog post, we are going to focus on the enhancements made to tuples and the `unknown` type! Feel free to check the handbook for an in-depth view of [TypeScript Project References](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/project-references.html).

## TypeScript Quick Setup

If you want to follow along with the example in this post, you can follow these quick steps to get a TypeScript 3.0 project up and running.

If you prefer to test TypeScript 3.0 on a sandbox environment, you can use the [TypeScript playground](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play/) instead to follow along.

### Setting Up a TypeScript Project

In any directory of your choice, create a `ts3` directory and make it your current directory:

```shell
mkdir ts3
cd ts3
```

Once `ts3` is the current working directory, initialize a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) project with default values:

```shell
npm init -y
```

Next, install core packages that are needed to compile and monitor changes in TypeScript files:

```shell
npm i typescript nodemon ts-node --save-dev
```

A TypeScript project needs a `tsconfig.json` file. This can be done in two ways: using the global `tsc` command or using `npx tsc`. I recommend using `npx`.

The `npx` command is available in `npm >= 5.2` and it lets you create a `tsconfig.json` file as follows:

```shell
npx tsc --init
```

Here, `npx` executes the local `typescript` package that has been installed locally.

If you prefer to do so using a global package, ensure that you [install TypeScript globally](https://www.typescriptlang.org/#download-links) and run the following:

```shell
tsc --init
```

You will see the following message in the command line once's that done:

```shell
Successfully created a tsconfig.json file.
```

You will also have a `tsconfig.json` file with sensible started defaults enabled. For the scope of this tutorial, those configuration settings are more than enough.

### Compiling, Running, and Watching TypeScript

In a development world where everything build-related is now automated, an easy way to compile, run, and watch TypeScript files is needed. This can be done through `nodemon` and `ts-node`:

- [`nodemon`](https://github.com/remy/nodemon): It's a tool that monitors for any changes in a Node.js application directory and automatically restarts the server.

- [`ts-node`](https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-node): It's a TypeScript execution and REPL for Node.js, with source map support. Works with `typescript@>=2.0`.

The executables of these two packages need to be run together through an `npm` script. In your code editor or IDE, update the `package.json` as follows:

```json
{
  // ...
  "scripts": {
    "watch": "nodemon --watch 'src/**/*.ts' --exec 'ts-node' src/index.ts"
  }
  // ...
}
```

The `watch` script is doing a lot of hard work:

```shell
nodemon --watch 'src/**/*.ts' --exec 'ts-node' src/index.ts
```

The `nodemon` executable takes a `--watch` argument. The `--watch` option is followed by a string that specifies the directories that need to be watched and follows the [glob pattern](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)>).

Next, the `--exec` option is passed. The [`--exec`](https://github.com/remy/nodemon#running-non-node-scripts) option is used to run non-node scripts. `nodemon` will read the file extension of the script being run and monitor that extension instead of `.js`. In this case, `--exec` runs `ts-node`.

`ts-node` executes any passed TypeScript files as `node` + `tsc`. In this case, it receives and executes `src/index.ts`.

> In some other setups, two different shells may be used: One to compile and watch the TypeScript files and another one to run resultant JavaScript file through `node` or `nodemon`.

Finally, create a `src` folder under the project directory, `ts3`, and create `index.ts` within it.

### Running a TypeScript Project

With all dependencies installed and scripts set up, you are ready to run the project. Execute the following command in the shell:

```shell
npm run watch
```

Messages about `nodemon` will come up. Since `index.ts` is empty as of now, there's no other output in the shell.

You are all set up! Now join me in exploring what new features come with TypeScript 3.

## TypeScript TupleWare

### What Are TypeScript Tuples?

TypeScript 3 comes with a couple of changes to how tuples can be used. Therefore, let's quickly review the [basics of TypeScript tuples](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/basic-types.html).

A tuple is a TypeScript type that works like an array with some special considerations:

- The number of elements of the array is fixed.
- The type of the elements is known.
- The type of the elements of the array need not be the same.

For example, through a tuple, we can represent a value as a pair of a string and a boolean. Let's head to `index.ts` and populate it with the following code:

```typescript
// Declare the tuple
let option: [string, boolean];

// Correctly initialize it
option = ["uppercase", true];
```

If we change value of `option` to `[true, "uppercase"]`, we'll get an error:

```typescript
// Declare the tuple
let option: [string, boolean];

// Correctly initialize it
option = ["uppercase", true];

// Incorrect value order
option = [true, "uppercase"];
```

```shell
src/index.ts(8,11): error TS2322: Type 'true' is not assignable to type 'string'.
src/index.ts(8,17): error TS2322: Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'boolean'.
```

Let's delete the incorrect example from our code and move forward with the understanding that, with tuples, the order of values is critical. Relying on order can make code difficult to read, maintain, and use. For that reason, it's a good idea to use tuples with data that is related to each other in a sequential manner. That way, accessing the elements in order is part of a predictable and expected pattern.

The coordinates of a point are examples of data that is sequential. A three-dimensional coordinate always comes in a three-number pattern:

```shell
(x, y, z)
```

On a Cartesian plane, the order of the points will always be sequential. We could represent this three-dimensional coordinate as the following tuple:

```typescript
type Point3D = [number, number, number];
```

Therefore, `Point3D[0]`, `Point3D[1]`, and `Point3D[2]` would be logically digestible and easier to map than other disjointed data.

<p style="text-align: center;">

</p>

[Source](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/3D_coordinate_system.svg/2000px-3D_coordinate_system.svg.png)

On the other hand, associated data that is loosely tied is not beneficial. For example, we could have three pieces of `customerData` that are `email`, `phoneNumber`, and `dateOfBirth`. `customerData[0]`, `customerData[1]`, and `customerData[2]` say nothing about what type of data each represents. We would need to trace the code or read the documentation to find out how the data is being mapped. This is not an ideal scenario and using an `interface` would be much better.

That's it for tuples! They provide us with a fixed size container that can store values of all kinds of types. Now, let's see what TypeScript changes about using tuples in version `3.0` of the language.

### Using TypeScript Tuples in Rest Parameters

In JavaScript, the [rest parameter](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/rest_parameters) syntax allows us to "represent an indefinite number of arguments as an array."

However, as we reviewed earlier, in TypeScript, tuples are special arrays that can contain elements of different types.

With TypeScript 3, the rest parameter syntax allows us to represent a finite number of arguments of different types as a tuple. The rest parameter expands the elements of the tuple into discrete parameters.

Let's look at the following function signature as an example:

```typescript
declare function example(...args: [string, boolean, number]): void;
```

Here, the `args` parameter is a tuple type that contains three elements of type `string`, `boolean`, and `number`. Using the rest parameter syntax, (`...`), `args` is expanded in a way that makes the function signature above equivalent to this one:

```typescript
declare function example(args_0: string, args_1: boolean, args_2: number): void;
```

To access `args_0`, `args_1`, and `args_2` within the body of a function, we would use array notation: `args[0]`, `args[1]`, and `args[2]`.

The goal of the rest parameter syntax is to collect "argument overflow" into a single structure: an array or a tuple.

In action, we could call the `example` function as follows:

```typescript
example("TypeScript example", true, 100);
```

TypeScript will pack that into the following tuple since `example`, as first defined, only takes one parameter:

```typescript
["TypeScript example", true, 100];
```

Then the rest parameter syntax unpacks it within the parameter list and makes it easily accessible to the body of the function using array index notation with the same name of the rest parameter as the name of the tuple, `args[0]`.

Using our `Point3D` tuple example, we could define a function like this:

```typescript
declare function draw(...point3D: [number, number, number]): void;
```

As before, we would access each coordinate point as follows: `point3D[0]` for `x`, `point3D[1]` for `y`, and `point3D[2]` for `z`.

How is this different from just passing an array? A tuple type forces us to pass a number for `x`, `y`, and `z` while an array could be empty. A tuple will throw an error if we are not passing exactly 3 numbers to the `draw` function.

### Spread Expressions with TypeScript Tuples

The rest parameter syntax looks very familiar to the spread operator; however, they are very different. As we learned earlier, the rest parameter syntax collects parameters into a single variable and then expands them under its variable name. On the other hand, the spread operator expands the elements of an array or object. With TypeScript 3.0, the spread operator can also expand the elements of a tuple.

Let's see this in action using our `Point3D` tuple. Let's replace the code in `index.ts` and populate it with the following:

```typescript
type Point3D = [number, number, number];

const draw = (...point3D: Point3D) => {
  console.log(point3D);
};

const xyzCoordinate: Point3D = [10, 20, 10];

draw(10, 20, 10);
draw(xyzCoordinate[0], xyzCoordinate[1], xyzCoordinate[2]);
draw(...xyzCoordinate);
```

We create a `Point3D` to represent the `(10, 20, 10)` coordinate and store it in the `xyzCoordinate` constant. Notice that we have three ways to pass a point to the `draw` function:

- Passing the values as literals:

```typescript
draw(10, 20, 10);
```

- Passing indexes to the corresponding `xyzCoordinate` tuple:

```typescript
draw(xyzCoordinate[0], xyzCoordinate[1], xyzCoordinate[2]);
```

- Using the spread operator to pass the full `xyzCoordinate` tuple:

```typescript
draw(...xyzCoordinate);
```

As we can see, using the spread operator is a fast and clean option for passing a tuple as an argument.

### Optional Tuple Elements

With TypeScript 3.0, our tuples can have optional elements that are specified using the `?` postfix.

We could create a generic `Point` tuple that could become two or three-dimensional depending on how many tuple elements are specified:

```typescript
type Point = [number, number?, number?];

const x: Point = [10];
const xy: Point = [10, 20];
const xyz: Point = [10, 20, 10];
```

We could determine what kind of point is being represented by the constant by checking the `length` of the tuple. Let's replace the content of `index.ts` with the following:

```typescript
type Point = [number, number?, number?];

const x: Point = [10];
const xy: Point = [10, 20];
const xyz: Point = [10, 20, 10];

console.log(x.length);
console.log(xy.length);
console.log(xyz.length);
```

The code above outputs the following in the console:

```shell
1
2
3
```

Notice that the length of each of the `Point` tuples varies by the number of elements the tuple has. The `length` property of a tuple with optional elements is the "union of the numeric literal types representing the possible lengths" as stated in the [TypeScript release](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-3-0.html).

The type of the length property in the `Point` tuple type `[number, number?, number?]` is `1 | 2 | 3`.

As a rule, if we need to list multiple optional elements, they have to be listed with the postfix `?` modifier on its type at the end of the tuple. An optional element cannot have required elements to its right but it can have as many optional elements as desired instead.

The following code would result in an error:

```
type Point = [number, number?, number];
```

```shell
error TS1257: A required element cannot follow an optional element.
```

In `--strictNullChecks` mode, using the `?` modifier automatically includes `undefined` in the tuple element type. This behavior is similar to what TypeScript does with optional parameters.

> Tuples are like Tupperware containers that let you store different types of food on each container. We can collect and bundle the containers and we can disperse them as well. At the same time, we can make it optional to fill a container. However, it would be a good idea to keep the containers with uncertain content at the bottom of the stack to make the containers with guaranteed content both easy to find and predictable.

### Rest Elements In Tuple Types

In TypeScript 3.0, the last element of a tuple can be a rest element, `...element`. The one restriction for this rest element is that it has to be an array type. This structure is useful when we want to create open-ended tuples that may have zero or more additional elements. It's a boost over the optional `?` postfix as it allows us to specify a variable number of optional elements with the one condition that they have to be of the same type.

For example, `[string, ...number[]]` represents a tuple with a string element followed by any amount of `number` elements. This tuple could represent a student name followed by test scores.

Replace the content of `index.ts` with the following:

```typescript
type TestScores = [string, ...number[]];

const thaliaTestScore = ["Thalia", ...[100, 98, 99, 100]];
const davidTestScore = ["David", ...[100, 98, 100]];

console.log(thaliaTestScore);
console.log(davidTestScore);
```

Output:

```shell
[ 'Thalia', 100, 98, 99, 100 ]
[ 'David', 100, 98, 100 ]
```

> Don't forget to add the `...` operator to the `array`. Otherwise, the tuple will get the array as it second element and nothing else. The `array` elements won't spread out into the tuple:

```typescript
type TestScores = [string, ...number[]];

const thaliaTestScore = ["Thalia", [100, 98, 99, 100]];
const davidTestScore = ["David", [100, 98, 100]];

console.log(thaliaTestScore);
console.log(davidTestScore);
```

Output:

```shell
[ 'Thalia', [ 100, 98, 99, 100 ] ]
[ 'David', [ 100, 98, 100 ] ]
```

## TypeScript: Into the Unknown

TypeScript 3.0 introduces a new type called `unknown`. `unknown` acts like a type-safe version of `any` by requiring us to perform some type of checking before we can use the value of the `unknown` element or any of its properties. Let's explore the rules around this wicked type!

`any` is too flexible. As the name suggests, it can encompass the type of every possible value in TypeScript. What's not so ideal of this premise is that `any` doesn't require us to do any kind of checking before we make use of the properties of its value.

In the following code, `itemLocation` is defined as having type `any` and it's assigned the value of `10`, but we use it unsafely. Replace the content of `index.ts` with this:

```typescript
let itemLocation: any = 10;

itemLocation.coordinates.x;
itemLocation.coordinates.y;
itemLocation.coordinates.z;

const findItem = (loc: string) => {
  console.log(loc.toLowerCase());
};

findItem(itemLocation);

itemLocation();

const iPhoneLoc = new itemLocation();
```

We tried to access a `coordinates` property from `itemLocation` that doesn't exist. We also passed it as an argument to a function that takes an argument of type `string`. We called it as a function. Lastly, we used it as a constructor. Throughout the execution of these statements, TypeScript throws errors but it doesn't get upset enough to stop compilation:

```shell
TypeError: Cannot read property 'x' of undefined
```

Let's see what happens when we change the type of `itemLocation` from `any` to `unknown`:

```typescript
let itemLocation: unknown = 10;

itemLocation.coordinates.x;
itemLocation.coordinates.y;
itemLocation.coordinates.z;

const findItem = (loc: string) => {
  console.log(loc.toLowerCase());
};

findItem(itemLocation);

itemLocation();

const iPhoneLoc = new itemLocation();
```

Our IDE or code editor will instantly underline `itemLocation` with red in any of the instances where we are accessing its properties unsafely. This time around, TypeScript doesn't merely throw an error but actually stops compilation:

```shell
TSError: ⨯ Unable to compile TypeScript:
src/index.ts(3,1): error TS2571: Object is of type 'unknown'.
src/index.ts(4,1): error TS2571: Object is of type 'unknown'.
src/index.ts(5,1): error TS2571: Object is of type 'unknown'.
src/index.ts(11,10): error TS2345: Argument of type 'unknown' is not assignable to parameter of type 'string'.
src/index.ts(13,1): error TS2571: Object is of type 'unknown'.
src/index.ts(15,23): error TS2571: Object is of type 'unknown'.
```

We can use an `unknown` type **if and only if we perform some form of checking on its structure**. We can either check the structure of the element we want to use, or we can use type assertion to tell TypeScript that we are confident about the type of the value. Let's see this in code.

### Performing an Explicit Structural Check

Let's start with the following code that uses `any` as the type of `itemLocation`:

```typescript
let itemLocation: any = {
  coordinates: { x: 10, y: "cows", z: true }
};

console.log(itemLocation.coordinates.x);
console.log(itemLocation.coordinates.y);
console.log(itemLocation.coordinates.z);
```

This code is valid and the output in the console is as follows:

```shell
10
cows
true
```

However, if we change the type to `unknown`, we immediately get a compilation error:

```typescript
let itemLocation: unknown = {
  coordinates: { x: 10, y: "cows", z: true }
};

console.log(itemLocation.coordinates.x);
console.log(itemLocation.coordinates.y);
console.log(itemLocation.coordinates.z);
```

```shell
    return new TSError(diagnosticText, diagnosticCodes)
           ^
TSError: ⨯ Unable to compile TypeScript:
src/index.ts(5,13): error TS2571: Object is of type 'unknown'.
src/index.ts(6,13): error TS2571: Object is of type 'unknown'.
src/index.ts(7,13): error TS2571: Object is of type 'unknown'.
```

Because `itemLocation` is of type `unknown`, despite `itemLocation` having the `coordinates` property object defined with its own `x`, `y`, and `z` properties, TypeScript won't let the compilation happen until we perform a type-check.

Let's create an `itemLocationCheck` method that checks for the structural integrity of `itemLocation`:

```typescript
let itemLocation: unknown = {
  coordinates: { x: 10, y: "cows", z: true }
};

const itemLocationCheck = (
  loc: any
): loc is { coordinates: { x: any; y: any; z: any } } => {
  return (
    !!loc &&
    typeof loc === "object" &&
    "coordinates" in loc &&
    "x" in loc.coordinates &&
    "y" in loc.coordinates &&
    "z" in loc.coordinates
  );
};

if (itemLocationCheck(itemLocation)) {
  console.log(itemLocation.coordinates.x);
  console.log(itemLocation.coordinates.y);
  console.log(itemLocation.coordinates.z);
}
```

We get the output back in the console:

```shell
10
cows
true
```

When we pass `itemLocation` to `itemLocationCheck` as a parameter, `itemLocationCheck` performs a structural check on it:

- It checks that `loc` is defined.
- It checks that `loc` is of type `object`.
- It checks that `loc` has a property named `coordinates`.
  - Once this is done, it checks that `coordinates` has properties named `x`, `y`, and `z`.

If all these checks pass, the logic within the `if` statement is executed. These checks are enough to convince TypeScript that we have done our due diligence on checking the integrity of the `unknown` type element and it gives us permission to use it.

How strict is TypeScript with the structural check? Do we need to check for the existence of every property of the object? Let's modify `itemLocationCheck` for it not to check the `coordinates.z` property:

```typescript
let itemLocation: unknown = {
  coordinates: { x: 10, y: "cows", z: true }
};

const itemLocationCheck = (
  loc: any
): loc is { coordinates: { x: any; y: any } } => {
  return (
    !!loc &&
    typeof loc === "object" &&
    "coordinates" in loc &&
    "x" in loc.coordinates &&
    "y" in loc.coordinates
  );
};

if (itemLocationCheck(itemLocation)) {
  console.log(itemLocation.coordinates.x);
  console.log(itemLocation.coordinates.y);
  console.log(itemLocation.coordinates.z);
}
```

The execution of the code above results in a compilation error:

```shell
TSError: ⨯ Unable to compile TypeScript:
src/index.ts(20,40): error TS2339: Property 'z' does not exist on type '{ x: any; y: any; }'.
```

The critical part of the structural check we are doing comes from the usage of the `is` keyword in the return type of `itemLocationCheck`.

Let's recap [what the `is` keyword does in TypeScript](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40081332/what-does-the-is-keyword-do-in-typescript). We define the following type predicate as the return type of `itemLocationCheck` instead of just using a `boolean` return type:

```typescript
loc is { coordinates: { x: any; y: any } }
```

Using the type predicate has the giant benefit that when `itemLocationCheck` is called, if the function returns a truthy value, **TypeScript will narrow the type to `{ coordinates: { x: any; y: any } }` in any block guarded by a call to `itemLocationCheck`** as explained by [StackOverflow contributor Aries Chui](https://stackoverflow.com/a/45748366).

The type narrowing done by `is` creates the error within the `if` block because for TypeScript, within that block, `itemLocation` has a `coordinates` property and that `coordinates` property only has the properties `x` and `y`. It doesn't matter that outside of the scope of that block `itemLocation.coordinates.z` exists and is defined.

If we put `z` back in the return type predicate while still not performing the `"z" in loc.coordinates`
check, TypeScript would not throw a compilation error:

```typescript
let itemLocation: unknown = {
  coordinates: { x: 10, y: "cows", z: true }
};

const itemLocationCheck = (
  loc: any
): loc is { coordinates: { x: any; y: any; z: any } } => {
  return (
    !!loc &&
    typeof loc === "object" &&
    "coordinates" in loc &&
    "x" in loc.coordinates &&
    "y" in loc.coordinates
  );
};

if (itemLocationCheck(itemLocation)) {
  console.log(itemLocation.coordinates.x);
  console.log(itemLocation.coordinates.y);
  console.log(itemLocation.coordinates.z);
}
```

In essence, what TypeScript wants us to do when using the `unkown` type is for us to make it known before we use it. We do not modify the type of the element but we do modify how TypeScript sees it.

Let's explore next how we can do this using type assertion.

### Performing a Type Assertion

We can also satisfy TypeScript `unknown` check by doing a type assertion. Let's use again our base example but this time let's start `itemLocation` with the `unknown` type:

```typescript
let itemLocation: unknown = {
  coordinates: { x: 10, y: "cows", z: true }
};

console.log(itemLocation.coordinates.x);
console.log(itemLocation.coordinates.y);
console.log(itemLocation.coordinates.z);
```

As expected, we get a compilation error. Let's then create a `KnownStructure` type and use it to assert the type of `itemLocation`:

```typescript
type KnownStructure = { coordinates: { x: any; y: any; z: any } };

let itemLocation: unknown = {
  coordinates: { x: 10, y: "cows", z: true }
};

console.log((itemLocation as KnownStructure).coordinates.x);
console.log((itemLocation as KnownStructure).coordinates.y);
console.log((itemLocation as KnownStructure).coordinates.z);
```

Instead of an error, this time around the code compiles and we get our desired output:

```shell
10
cows
true
```

Now, we can create a `printLocation` function that attempts to print `itemLocation` in lowercase. We know that this won't work because `itemLocation` is not a string. However, we can make TypeScript believe it is of type `string` through type assertion, allowing compilation but then throwing an error:

```typescript
type KnownStructure = { coordinates: { x: any; y: any; z: any } };

let itemLocation: unknown = {
  coordinates: { x: 10, y: "cows", z: true }
};

console.log((itemLocation as KnownStructure).coordinates.x);
console.log((itemLocation as KnownStructure).coordinates.y);
console.log((itemLocation as KnownStructure).coordinates.z);

const printLocation = (loc: string) => {
  console.log(loc.toLowerCase());
};

printLocation(itemLocation as string);
```

```shell
  console.log(loc.toLowerCase());
                  ^
TypeError: loc.toLowerCase is not a function
```

## Conclusion

I recommend starting to use `unknown` instead of `any` for handling responses from APIs that may have anything on the response. Having `unknown` in place forces us to check for the integrity and structure of the response and promotes defensive but sane coding.
