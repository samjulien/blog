**TL;DR:** This is a small series on how to build a full-stack TypeScript application using Angular and Nest.js. [In the first part, you learnt how to build a simple API with Nest.js]((https://auth0.com/blog/typescript-from-top-to-bottom-part-1-developing-an-api-with-nestjs). In this second part, you are going to learn how to use Angular to build the frontend application that communicates with Nest.js. [You can find the final code developed throughout this article in this GitHub repository](https://github.com/auth0-blog/).

## Summarizing Part 1

[In the first part]((https://auth0.com/blog/typescript-from-top-to-bottom-part-1-developing-an-api-with-nestjs), you learnt why you should use [Angular](https://angular.io/) together with [Nest.js](https://nestjs.com/) to create a full-stack web application using TypeScript.

Then, you created a Nest.js backend app that manages the menu of a restaurant. This API had three endpoints. One that accepts unauthenticated requests (`GET /items`), another one that accepts requests from any authenticated user (`POST /shop-cart`), and the third one that accepts requests only from users authenticated as administrators (`POST /items`).

As you will need this backend application to support your Angular app, make sure you have it up and running:

```bash
# move into the backend directory
cd nest-restaurant-api

# run the server
npm start
```

## Scaffolding an Angular Application

To facilitate the process of scaffolding an Angular app, you are going to use the [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) tool. Installing this tool requires only Node and NPM, which you probably already have as you have followed the first article. Having those, you can open a new terminal and run the following command to install Angular CLI:

```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

Then, to generate a new Angular application, move into the directory where you usually put your projects and run the following:

```bash
ng new angular-restaurant-app
```

After a while, Angular CLI will generate a project with the following structure:

```bash
├── README.md
├── angular.json
├── package-lock.json
├── package.json
├── src
│   ├── app
│   │   ├── app.component.css
│   │   ├── app.component.html
│   │   ├── app.component.spec.ts
│   │   ├── app.component.ts
│   │   └── app.module.ts
│   ├── assets
│   ├── browserslist
│   ├── environments
│   │   ├── environment.prod.ts
│   │   └── environment.ts
│   ├── favicon.ico
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── karma.conf.js
│   ├── main.ts
│   ├── polyfills.ts
│   ├── styles.css
│   ├── test.ts
│   ├── tsconfig.app.json
│   ├── tsconfig.spec.json
│   └── tslint.json
├── tsconfig.json
└── tslint.json
```

Throughout this article, you are mainly going to create code located under the `src/app` directory. In the structure created, you will see some files related to automated tests (like `test.ts` and these files that have `spec` in their names). Although implementing automated tests is extremely important, in this article, you are going to ignore them so you can achieve your goal faster.

> **Note:** [If you want to learn about testing Angular applications, please, check this series that we prepared for you](https://auth0.com/blog/angular-2-testing-in-depth-services/).


> **Note:** [If you have questions about what role each file and directory plays, you can find answers in Angular's documentation page](https://angular.io/guide/quickstart).

After scaffolding your Angular app, you can make it run by issuing the following commands:

```bash
# moves into your new Angular app
cd angular-restaurant-app

# starts the Angular app and open it in the default browser
ng serve --open
```

After running these, Angular CLI will open your browser at [localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200) and you will see a page like this:

![Scaffolding an Angular app](https://cdn.auth0.com/blog/fullstack-typescript/scaffolding-angular.png)

## Developing Frontend Apps with Angular

To make the article easier to grasp, first, you are going to develop an Angular app that doesn't interact with your backend API. After that, you will integrate it with both your Nest.js API and with Auth0 (so your users can authenticate).

### Angular and Bootstrap

As you don't want develop an ugly app and you don't want to invest too much time working on CSS either, you are going to use [Twitter's Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) to give some basic style to your app. To import bootstrap, stop the Angular development server and run the following command:

```bash
npm install bootstrap
```

Then, open the `src/styles.css` file and add the following line to it:

```css
@import "bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css";
```

### Showing the Menu with an Angular Component

The first feature you are going to implement in your app is the view where unauthorized users can check what is in the menu. So, to do that, you are going to create a new Angular component by running the following code in the project root:

```bash
ng generate component items
```

After that, you will get a new folder called `items` with three main files (plus one for tests that you won't use):

* `items.component.css`: This is the file where you may add some local style for your new Angular component.
* `items.component.html`: This is the file where you are going to add the HTML code to structure your information.
* `items.component.ts`: This is the file where you are going to place the code that controls the behavior of this component.

The next step will be creating the an interface ([the same that you have created in your Nest.js backend API](https://github.com/auth0-blog/nest-restaurant-api/blob/master/src/items/item.interface.ts)) to represent items on the menu. As both your projects (the Angular one and the Nest.js one) will exchange data with this structure, you have to define the same structure on both sides. So, create a new file called `item.interface.ts` under the `./src/app/items` directory and add the following code to it:

```typescript
export class Item {
  readonly name: string;
  readonly price: number;
}
```

Then, open the `items.components.ts` file and replace its contents with this:

```typescript
import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import { Item } from './item.interface';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-items',
  templateUrl: './items.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./items.component.css']
})
export class ItemsComponent implements OnInit {
  items: Item [] = [{
    name: 'Pizza',
    price: 3
  },
  {
    name: 'Salad',
    price: 2
  }];
  constructor() { }

  addToCart() {
    window.alert('Added');
  }

  ngOnInit() {
  }
}
```

Basically, this version of the component is hard coding some items so you can see the view working. Also, this version is adding a fake `addToCart` method that simply confirms the action by triggering a `window.alert` with the _Added_ message.

Next, you are going to add the code needed in the HTML page. So, open the `items.component.html` file and replace its code with this:

{% highlight html %}
{% raw %}
<table class="table">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <td>Name</td>
      <td>Price</td>
      <td>Action</td>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr *ngFor="let item of items"> <!--for every item in object items, create a table row-->
      <td>{{item.name }}</td> <!--Write it's name in a column--> 
      <td>${{item.price}}</td> <!--Write it's price in a column--> 
      <td>
        <button class="btn btn-secondary"
                (click)="addToCart()">
          Add to shopping cart
        </button>
      </td>
    </tr> 
  </tbody>
</table>
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

As you can see, the code above contains an HTML `table` with a row (`tr`) that uses the `*ngFor` Angular directive. This directive makes Angular iterate over every item in the `items` array to build a table that exposes items' `price`, `name`, and a `button` to invoke the `addToCart` method.

Now, to show your new component, open the `src/app/app.component.html` file and replace everything with this:

{% highlight html %}
<app-items></app-items>
{% endhighlight %}

Then, run your project again to check if it is working:

```bash
ng serve --open
```

If everything is working as expected, you will see a web app like this one:
 
![Table of items](https://cdn.auth0.com/blog/fullstack-typescript/angular-menu-app-v1.png)

### Adding New Items Through a Reactive Angular Form

Next, you are going to create [a reactive Angular form](https://angular.io/guide/reactive-forms) to allow users to add new items to your `items` array. Using Angular's Reactive forms makes it easy to validate and test data that users input. To use this type of form, first, you will need to add Angular's form component to your `app.module.ts` file. that will look like that after the addition:

```typescript
// ... other import statements ...

@NgModule({
  // ... declarations ...
  imports: [
    BrowserModule,
    FormsModule,
    ReactiveFormsModule,
  ],
  // ... providers and bootstrap ...
})
export class AppModule { }
```

Then, you will need to add some code to `items.component.ts`, where you are going to add a few properties to the `ItemsComponent` class:

- `itemForm` (with the `formGroup` type) which is the form itself;
- and `itemSubmitted` a boolean used for validation.

You will also create a method for adding new items to the array. After adding these, your code will look like this:

```typescript
import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import { Item } from './item.interface';
import { FormGroup, Validators, FormBuilder } from '@angular/forms';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-items',
  templateUrl: './items.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./items.component.css']
})
export class ItemsComponent implements OnInit {
  items: Item [] = [{
    name: 'Pizza',
    price: 3
  },
  {
    name: 'Salad',
    price: 2
  }];
  itemSubmitted = false;
  itemForm: FormGroup;

  constructor(private formBuilder: FormBuilder) { }

  addToCart() {
    window.alert('Added');
  }

  ngOnInit() {
    // Initiating the form with the fields and the required validators
    this.itemForm = this.formBuilder.group({
      name: ['', Validators.required], // Name is required
      price: ['', [Validators.required, Validators.min(0)]] // Price is required and must be a positive number
    });
  }

  get getItemForm() {
    return this.itemForm.controls;
  }

  addNewItem() {
    this.itemSubmitted = true;
    if (this.itemForm.invalid) {
      console.log(this.itemForm);
    } else {
      this.items.push(this.itemForm.value);
    }
  }
}
```

> **Note**: you could create a new component to handle the form (e.g. `ItemsForm`) but, to keep things shorter, everything in this tutorial related to items will be created under the same component.

Now, you will need to update the `items.component.html` file. There, you will add the HTML code that represents the form defined by the `itemForm` field. The following code snippet shows the tags that you will have to include after the `table` element present in the current code:

{% highlight html %}
{% raw %}
<!--><table class="table">...</table><!-->
<div>
  <h3 class="col-md-12">Add a new Item</h3>
  <form class="form-inline" (submit)="addNewItem()" [formGroup]="itemForm">
    <div class="col-auto">
      <input type="text" 
        class="form-control" 
        placeholder="Name" 
        formControlName="name" 
        [ngClass]="{ 'is-invalid': itemSubmitted && getItemForm.name.errors }" >
        <div *ngIf="itemSubmitted && getItemForm.name.errors" class="invalid-feedback">
          <div *ngIf="getItemForm.name.errors.required">Name is required</div>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="col-auto">
      <input type="number" 
        class="form-control" 
        placeholder="Price" 
        formControlName="price" 
        [ngClass]="{ 'is-invalid': itemSubmitted && getItemForm.price.errors }" >
        <div *ngIf="itemSubmitted && getItemForm.price.errors" class="invalid-feedback">
          <div *ngIf="getItemForm.price.errors.required">Price is required and must be a number</div>
          <div *ngIf="getItemForm.price.errors.min">Must start from 0</div>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="col-auto">
      <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary mb-2">Add new item</button>
    </div>
  </form>
</div>
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

After adding these HTML elements, you can head back to your app (i.e. open [localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200) in your browser if you closed it before) and you will see that your app looks like this:

![Using Angular Reactive Forms](https://cdn.auth0.com/blog/fullstack-typescript/using-angular-reactive-forms.png)

With these changes in place, you have finished developing the mock functionality that allows users to manage items on the menu. In the next sections, you will integrate your application with Auth0 and implement the missing parts that make your app communicate with the backend API.

## Integrating Angular Apps with Auth0

In the first part of this series, you have secured your Nest.js backend API with Auth0 to guarantee that only certain users can manage the list of items. As such, you will also need to integrate your Angular application with Auth0 so your users can authenticate to perform these actions.

### Installing the Dependencies

As you will see, securing Angular applications with Auth0 is really simple. First, you will only need to install two dependencies. So, stop your development server (which can be accomplished by hitting `CMD/CTRL` + `C`), then issue the following command on the project root:

```bash
npm install auth0-js @auth0/angular-jwt
```

### Creating an Auth0 Angular Service

After installing these libraries, you will need to create a Angular service to interact with [the Auth0 login page](https://auth0.com/docs/hosted-pages/login).

> **Note:** If you have ever created a similar service using browser's `localstorage` before, here you are going to use a better (more secure) strategy that requires new tokens to Auth0 every time the page reloads. This strategy avoids using `localstorage` and keeps everything in memory, so you will make your application safer .

To create this service, run the following command:

```bash
ng generate service auth/auth
```

Then, open the `auth.service.ts` file that was just created and replace its contents with the following:

```typescript
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { AuthOptions, WebAuth } from 'auth0-js';
import { JwtHelperService } from '@auth0/angular-jwt';

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})
export class AuthService {

  protected _auth0Client: WebAuth;
  private _accessToken: string;
  private _idToken: string;
  private _properties: AuthOptions;

  constructor() {
    this._properties = {
      clientID: '[CLIENT_ID]',
      domain: '[DOMAIN]',
      responseType: 'token id_token',
      audience: 'http://localhost:3000',
      redirectUri: 'http://localhost:4200/login',
      scope: 'openid profile'
    };
    this._auth0Client = new WebAuth({...this._properties});
  }

  public login(): void {
    // triggers auth0 authentication page
    this._auth0Client.authorize();
  }

  public checkSession(): Promise<boolean> {
    return new Promise<boolean>((resolve, reject) => {
      // checks in Auth0's server if the browser has a session
      this._auth0Client.checkSession(this._properties, async (error, authResult) => {
        if (error && error.error !== 'login_required') {
          // some other error
          return reject(error);
        } else if (error) {
          // explicit authentication
          this.handleAuthentication();          
          return resolve(false);
        }
        if (!this.isAuthenticated()) {
          this._setSession(authResult);
          return resolve(true);
        }
      });
    });
  }

  public isAuthenticated(): boolean {
    // Check whether the current time is past the
    // Access Token's expiry time
    return this._accessToken != null;
  }

  private handleAuthentication(): void {
    this._auth0Client.parseHash((err, authResult) => {
      if (authResult && authResult.accessToken && authResult.idToken) {
        window.location.hash = '';
        this._setSession(authResult);
      } else if (err) {
        console.log(err);
      }
    });
  }

  private _setSession(authResult): void {
    this._accessToken = authResult.accessToken;
    this._idToken = authResult.idToken;
  }
  
  // check if there is a property Admin in access token
  public isAdmin(): boolean {
    if (this._accessToken) {
      const helper = new JwtHelperService();
      const decodedToken = helper.decodeToken(this._accessToken);
      if (decodedToken['http://localhost:3000/roles'].indexOf('admin') > -1) {
        return true;
      } else {
        return false;
      }
    } else {
      return false;
    }
  }

  public getProfile(): Object {
    if (this._idToken) {
      const helper = new JwtHelperService();
      return helper.decodeToken(this._idToken);
    }
  }

  public getAccessToken(): String {
    return this._accessToken;
  }

  public logout(): void {
    // Remove tokens
    delete this._accessToken;
    delete this._idToken;
  }
}
```

The code snippets above contains two placeholders that you will need to replace: `[CLIENT_ID]` and `[DOMAIN]`. These placeholders refer to the Auth0 Application that you have created in the previous article. So, [open your Auth0 Dashboard, head to the Applications section](https://manage.auth0.com/#/applications), click on the Single Page Application you created, and copy the _Client ID_ and _Domain_ properties from it to replace these placeholders.

![Auth0 Angular Application](https://cdn.auth0.com/blog/fullstack-typescript/auth0-angular-application.png)

### Creating a Header Component with Angular

After creating this service, you are going to create a header component that will enable users to trigger the authentication process. To do that, create a new component called `header` by issuing `ng generate component header`. Then, open the `header.component.ts` file and replace its code with this:

```typescript
import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import { AuthService } from '../auth/auth.service';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-header',
  templateUrl: './header.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./header.component.css']
})
export class HeaderComponent implements OnInit {

  title = 'Food menu';

  constructor(private authService: AuthService) {
  }

  ngOnInit() {
  }

  isAuthenticated() {
    return this.authService.isAuthenticated();
  }

  login() {
    return this.authService.login();
  }

  logout() {
    return this.authService.logout();
  }

  getProfile() {
    return this.authService.getProfile();
  }
}
```

The code above is basically getting an instance of `AuthService` injected into the `authService` private field of this component. Then, you make use of this instance to redefine only the methods that you want to share with your view (avoiding to share unnecessary stuff).

Now, open the `header.component.html` file and replace its contents with this:

{% highlight html %}
{% raw %}
<nav class="navbar navbar-expand-lg navbar-light bg-light justify-content-between">
  <a class="navbar-brand" href="#">{{title}}</a>
  <button class="btn btn-primary login" *ngIf="!isAuthenticated()" (click)="login()">
      Login
  </button>
  <span  *ngIf="isAuthenticated()">
    <span>
      Logged in as:
      <img [src]="getProfile().picture" width="40">
      {{getProfile().name }}
    </span>
    <button class="btn btn-secondary" (click)="logout()">Logout</button>
  </span>
</nav>  
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

The elements above are basically verifying if the user is logged through the `*ngIF` directive. If the user is authenticated it will show the profile, otherwise it will show a login button.

Now, to use this component you need to add this line to the top of `app.component.html`:

{% highlight html %}
{% raw %}
<app-header></app-header>
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

Then, last but not least, you are going to add code to `app.component.ts` to handle authentication when Auth0 redirects back to your app's main page. [This will process the redirect URL and fetch the tokens from it](https://auth0.com/docs/users/redirecting-users)):

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { AuthService } from './auth/auth.service';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  templateUrl: './app.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./app.component.css']
})
export class AppComponent {
  constructor(private authService: AuthService) {
    this.authService.checkSession();
  }
}
```

Now, you may run your project (`ng serve --open`) and play with the authentication methods that you have developed. If everything is okay, you will see a page like the following one when you authenticate:

![User authenticated with Auth0 on an Angular app](https://cdn.auth0.com/blog/fullstack-typescript/angular-app-authenticated-with-auth0.png)

### Verify identity and authorization on items 

Now, remember one of your business rules:

> People who are not identified users should not be able to click the button to add an item to their shop cart and people who are not _admin_ users should not be able to include new items.

To accomplish that, you will need to import `AuthService` into `items.component.ts` just as you did into `header.component.ts`. The following code snippet shows the code that you will need to add in this component:

```typescript
// ... other import statements ...
import { AuthService } from '../auth/auth.service';

// ... @Component definition ...
export class ItemsComponent implements OnInit {
  // ... items, itemSubmitted, and itemForm definition ...

  constructor(private authService: AuthService, private formBuilder: FormBuilder) { }

  // ... ngOnInit, getItemForm, and addNewItem definition ...

  isAdmin() {
    return this.authService.isAdmin();
  }

  isAuthenticated() {
    return this.authService.isAuthenticated();
  }
}
```

Now, you will need to update the HTML template to execute some verification that checks if the current user has access to some of the services. To do that, open `items.component.html` and update the button that triggers `addToCart` as follows:

{% highlight html %}
{% raw %}
<!--The button will be disabled if is authenticated is false-->
<button class="btn btn-secondary"
  (click)="addToCart()"
  [disabled]="!isAuthenticated()">
  Add to shopping cart
</button>
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

Then, update the `div` that encapsulates the `h3` and the `form` element as follows:

{% highlight html %}
{% raw %}
<!--It will show the form div if the user is admin-->
<div *ngIf="isAdmin()">
  <!--> ... h3 and div ... <-->
</div>
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

Now, you can test your application with different accounts to see these changes in action.

## Integrating Angular with Nest.js

Now finally you are going to integrate this front end with the back end you created on part 1. 

### Create a Proxy

In order to interact with the backend service, you will need to deal with [CORS Cross Request Origin Sharing](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS), because the calls among the front end and back end will be blocked by the browser because of the [Same-origin policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy) used by most of the web browsers. 

One way to deal with that is going back to your backend and [enabling CORS on it](https://docs.nestjs.com/techniques/cors), to do that, just add the following line of code to `main.ts`. 

```typescript
...
app.enableCors();
...
```

It is a easy way to do that, but basically it allows any page on the web to have scripts inserted by your back end, which is not ideal. You can also set a proxy to your application when you deploys it (for example, a [NGINX proxy](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/web-server/reverse-proxy/)), but in this tutorial you are going to create a proxy for development (it should be used mainly when you are developing this application and should be changed by NGINX or something similar when you deploy it). To do that, create a file in the root of your project called `proxy.config.js`:

```javascript
const proxy = [
    {
      context: '/api',
      target: 'http://localhost:3000',
      pathRewrite: {'^/api' : ''}
    }
  ];
  
module.exports = proxy;

```

Now you can restart your application using this proxy by running the following command:

```bash
ng serve --proxy-config proxy.config.js
```

### Create Requests with Angular Services

You are going to need to import into your project Angular HTTP requester. Your `app.module.ts` will look like that after importing it:

```typescript

import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { HttpClientModule } from '@angular/common/http';

import { AppComponent } from './app.component';
import { ItemsComponent } from './items/items.component';
import { FormsModule, ReactiveFormsModule } from '@angular/forms';
import { HeaderComponent } from './header/header.component';

@NgModule({
  declarations: [
    AppComponent,
    ItemsComponent,
    HeaderComponent
  ],
  imports: [
    BrowserModule,
    FormsModule,
    ReactiveFormsModule,
    HttpClientModule
  ],
  providers: [],
  bootstrap: [ AppComponent ]
})
export class AppModule { }

```

Now, with this http document, you are going to create a service that does all the HTTP calls that you did on part 1 of this tutorial using curl. To generate this service, run the following command: 

```bash
ng generate service items/items # it will generate the service items inside of items folder
```

And then open the just created file and add the following code to it:

```typescript

import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { Observable } from 'rxjs';
import { Item } from './item.interface';
import { HttpClient, HttpHeaders } from '@angular/common/http';
import { AuthService } from '../auth/auth.service';

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})
export class ItemsService {

  constructor(private http: HttpClient, private auth: AuthService) { }

  // creates header
  private _authHeader(): Object {
    return {
      headers: new HttpHeaders({ 'authorization': `Bearer ${this.auth.getAccessToken()}`})
    };
  }

  public getItems(): Observable<Item[]> {
    return this.http.get<Item[]>('/api/items');
  }

  public postItems(item: Item): Observable<Item> {
    return this.http.post<Item>('/api/items', item, this._authHeader());
  }

  public postToShoppingCart(): Observable<String> {
    return this.http.post<String>('/api/shopping-cart', '', this._authHeader());
  }
}
```
As you may have noticed, every method other than `_authHeader()` (which adds the Auth0's token to the request). Now you are going to add the `items.service.ts` to the `items.component.ts`, the code will look like the following:

```typescript
import { ItemsService } from './items.service';
...
export class ItemsComponent implements OnInit {
..
items: Item [];
...
constructor(public authService: AuthService, private itemService: ItemsService, private formBuilder: FormBuilder) {}

 ngOnInit() {
    this.itemService.getItems().subscribe(items => this.items = items);
    ...
  }

  addToCart() {
    this.itemService.postToShoppingCart().subscribe(response => {
    }, error => {
        window.alert(error.error.message || error.error.text);
        console.log(error);
    });
  }

  addNewItem() {
    this.itemSubmitted = true;

    if (this.itemForm.invalid) {
      console.log(this.itemForm);
    } else {
      this.itemService.postItems(this.itemForm.value).subscribe(response => {
        window.location.reload();
      }, error => {
          window.alert(error.error.message);
      });
    }
  }
  ...
}

```

Now you may visit [localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200) and play around with your just integrated application.

## Conclusion

You learned how to create an application using typescript from back end to front end. It is not a production ready application yet: far from it! You will need to learn how to create tests to it, how to integrate it with a database as Mongo DB and many other things, but I hope that this tutorial will help you as an introduction to your further studies on NEST and Angular 6.
