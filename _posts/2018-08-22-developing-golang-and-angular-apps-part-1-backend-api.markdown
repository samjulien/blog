**TL;DR:** In this series, you will learn how to build modern applications with Golang and Angular. In the first article, you will build a secure backend API with Golang that will support a to-do list application. Then, in the second part, you will [use Angular to develop the frontend of the to-do list app](https://auth0.com/blog/developing-golang-and-angular-apps-part-2-angular-front-end). To facilitate the identity management, you will use Auth0 both in your backend API and in your Angular app to authenticate users. If needed, you can find the final code developed throughout this article in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/auth0-blog/golang-angular).

## Why Choose Golang and Angular

As mentioned, the technologies of choice for this series is [Golang](https://golang.org/) for the backend and [Angular](https://angular.io/) for the frontend. In this section, you will learn more about both platforms and why they are great options to develop applications nowadays.

### Golang Overview

Golang (or simply Go), is a statically-typed and pre-compiled programming language invented by Google. Over the last few years, Golang has become a very popular language, being the language of choice for projects such as [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), and all of [Hashicorps](https://www.hashicorp.com/) suite of programs.

Golang is not quite like other programming languages. This platform has a very strong standard library and can get very far before having to use third-party libraries. Also, Golang stands out for being compiled into a single binary, for having amazing support for concurrency, for facilitating testing and benchmarking, and for having a fantastic community behind it.

Although amazing, Golang is by no means the perfect language. However, the reason that I use it every day is for the simple reason that it get's the job done. Other than Python or Ruby, I don't believe there is a language as effective in time-to-deliver as Golang.

> **Note:** Wondering why I haven't chosen Ruby or Python? Well, the main reason is that I prefer statically typed compiled languages. This kind of programming language results in a faster application and avoids dependency hell for the end user. Also, I chose Golang because it has excellent cross-platform compilation support, making it even more attractive as a programming language.

### Angular Overview

Currently, the only real viable choice for writing a frontend web app is using JavaScript. All browsers support it to a satisfactory degree and, as such, using it will make you avoid strange dependency and compatibility issues.

So, that makes choosing the frontend technology easy, right? Nope! As of writing this article, there are currently three major frameworks/libraries that professional web app developers are using. They are React, Vue.js, and Angular. If you go out there and research, you will probably find another 100 smaller frameworks. But, for the moment, they still have to prove that they can handle production-ready applications.

Now, you can find articles around the web that states that "Framework X is much better than frameworks Y & Z, because of whatever". Or, you can find articles describing that all three frameworks mentioned are essentially dead because of some new framework.

Going into the politics of the frontend frameworks and getting into these discussions is just not worth the effort. The truth is, if you stick to one of the three major frameworks/libraries, you will be able to accomplish the same thing. Also, the result that they produce is quite similar. If you take a closer look, you will see that all of these frontend solutions use Yarn or NPM to download hundreds of megabytes of god knows what in your `node_modules` directory to then compress all of this into smaller HTML and JavaScript files.

Nevertheless, I feel like you deserve an explanation on why I chose Angular for this job. I like Angular because it comes with everything that I expect to come to a web framework. Some standard components, easy management of libraries, routing and authentication support, etc. Basically speaking, Angular makes life easy and, well, who doesn't like an easy life?.

React is also a super strong library (and a great alternative for this job). However, I have OCD (Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder) issues with HTML elements being added to JavaScript files. Just like many people have issues with their different foods touching one another on their plate.

Lastly, there is Vue.js, which is also a very strong and popular framework. As of now, I cannot tell you a technical reason to choose Angular over Vue.js. One thing I know, though, is that Angular still is much more popular and well supported than Vue.js. However, I started out with Angular and Angular does the job for me.

Either way, Angular is another project backed by Google, much like Golang. This framework has sprouted from its old brother AngularJS, which was **THE** JavaScript framework a few years ago. The new Angular is not as popular, which I think there are a few reasons for. For example, nowadays there is more competition, mainly with React and Vue.js. Also, there were a lot of breaking changes during the first Angular versions released (even when no breaking changes were supposed to be published). And, the last reason (which causes a lot of confusion) is the versioning convention.

Instead of making versions such as `2.2.1.1`, the team responsible for Angular decided that all breaking changes would cause a total version aggregation. So, the current version of Angular (as of writing this article) is Angular 6. This makes it difficult to Google (ironically) and also weird to refer to, and there are many different ways to refer to it: Angular, Angular 2+, Angular 6, etc.

Despite all of this, I still think that Angular is an excellent frontend framework for web applications. I love that it leverages the use of TypeScript and, thereby standardizing the structure of code and as mentioned earlier, I love the `angular-cli` toolbox (which comes with all the tools I need and expect out of the box).

## Prerequisites

For this tutorial, you will need to install Golang, Node.js, and Angular. However, as you will see, the process is quite simple. For starters, you can visit [the official installation instructions provided by Golang](https://golang.org/doc/install) to install the programming language.

After that, you will need to install Node.js (which comes with NPM). For that, you can follow [the instructions described here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

Then, after installing Node.js and NPM, you can issue the following command to install the [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/) tool:

```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

> **Note:** By adding `-g` in the command above, you make NPM install the Angular CLI tool globally. That is, after issuing this command, you will have the `ng` command in all new sessions of your terminal. 

## Building Backend APIs with Golang

In this section, you will learn how to build backend APIs with Golang. To facilitate your life, you will use [Gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin), an HTTP web framework written in Golang. Gin is, like many other frameworks, an open-source project that simplifies creating API endpoints.

What is good to keep in mind is that nothing that you will build in this article is impossible to do with the standard library of Golang. The only reason why you are using Gin is because it simplifies and standardizes the process a little, making your life easier.

### Creating an In-Memory To-Do List with Golang

Before you start developing your web server, you will start writing the component that will handle the to-do list. To keep things simple, the implementation of this component will consist of a static object that will store all to-do items in-memory. Essentially, this component will work a very simple database (one that does not persist data to disk though).

Typically, this is not a bad way to start out the development process. Implementing a mock version of your database (before implementing your actual database) not only makes testing easier (and something that you can do from the beginning of your project) but it also helps to imply an interface for your store (or database).

Enough said, it's time to get started with your backend API. Golang, by default, will look for packages in the `GO_PATH` environment variable. This variable usually refers to a place in the user directory (i.e., on Unix-like systems, this would be `~/go`, and on Windows, this would be `%USERPROFILE%/go`).

Packages are then stored in `$GO_PATH/src/` and, therefore, placing your projects there will make your life a lot easier. For this tutorial, you can place your Golang project in the `~/go/src/github.com/<YOUR_GITHUB_USER>/golang-angular` (you might have to create some of these directories). For the rest of the article, this directory will be referred to as the project root or simply `./`.

> **Note:** You will have to replace `<YOUR_GITHUB_USER>` with your own GitHub username. That is, you do have a GitHub account, right?

So, in your project root (`./`), create a new directory called `todo`. Then, inside this directory, create a new file called `todo.go` with the following code:

```go
package todo

import (
	"errors"
	"sync"

	"github.com/rs/xid"
)

var (
	list []Todo
	mtx  sync.RWMutex
	once sync.Once
)

func init() {
	once.Do(initialiseList)
}

func initialiseList() {
	list = []Todo{}
}

// Todo data structure for a task with a description of what to do
type Todo struct {
	ID       string `json:"id"`
	Message  string `json:"message"`
	Complete bool   `json:"complete"`
}

// Get retrieves all elements from the todo list
func Get() []Todo {
	return list
}

// Add will add a new todo based on a message
func Add(message string) string {
	t := newTodo(message)
	mtx.Lock()
	list = append(list, t)
	mtx.Unlock()
	return t.ID
}

// Delete will remove a Todo from the Todo list
func Delete(id string) error {
	location, err := findTodoLocation(id)
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}
	removeElementByLocation(location)
	return nil
}

// Complete will set the complete boolean to true, marking a todo as
// completed
func Complete(id string) error {
	location, err := findTodoLocation(id)
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}
	setTodoCompleteByLocation(location)
	return nil
}

func newTodo(msg string) Todo {
	return Todo{
		ID:       xid.New().String(),
		Message:  msg,
		Complete: false,
	}
}

func findTodoLocation(id string) (int, error) {
	mtx.RLock()
	defer mtx.RUnlock()
	for i, t := range list {
		if isMatchingID(t.ID, id) {
			return i, nil
		}
	}
	return 0, errors.New("could not find todo based on id")
}

func removeElementByLocation(i int) {
	mtx.Lock()
	list = append(list[:i], list[i+1:]...)
	mtx.Unlock()
}

func setTodoCompleteByLocation(location int) {
	mtx.Lock()
	list[location].Complete = true
	mtx.Unlock()
}

func isMatchingID(a string, b string) bool {
	return a == b
}
```

In the very top of the bottom (right after defining the package and importing a few other packages), you will find the variables that will be globally-available in this file:

- `list`: This is the array that will hold all to-do items.
- `mtx`: This is the [mutex](https://gobyexample.com/mutexes) that will allow you to safely access/manipulate the data in this package across different [_goroutines_](https://gobyexample.com/goroutines).
- `once`: This is a Golang native functionality ([`sync.Once`](https://golang.org/pkg/sync/#Once)), which will help you assure that a specific operation will run only once.

After the declaration of these variables, you will find the `init` function and you will see that it runs another function called `initialiseList`. The latter is responsible for initializing the array of to-do items but will ensure that this initialization will run only once. As Golang runs the `init` function whenever the package is initialized (i.e., whenever the package is loaded), you needed to wrap the `initialiseList` function inside `once.Do`. In this way, you avoid resetting the array on the runtime.

Then, after these two functions that initialize the package, you will find the `Todo` structure. This struct defines that to-do items will have an `ID`, a `Message` and whether the todo item is `Complete` or not. Also, while defining this struct, you are also mapping all properties of your struct into its JSON equivalent. This is a very useful feature in Golang and, if needed, [you can find more info about it here](https://blog.golang.org/json-and-go). As the naming convention in Golang defines that all properties starting with a capital letter are public and all starting with a small letter are private in a struct, this mapping also helps you ensure you can stick with the naming conventions available in JSON.

> **Note:** If you were to define other packages that would use this struct, it would be a good idea to place it in another package for itself. However, for this simple application, placing it here will suffice.

Right after the definition of the `Todo` struct, you will find the first method of your to-do store: `Get`. This method starts with a capital letter and, therefore, is public (meaning it can be accessed by other packages). The `Get` method implementation is very simple, it simply returns your current static to-do list (the global `list` variable).

Then, below this method, you will find the `Add` method, which will create a new to-do (based on a user input message) and append to the global `list`. Notice that you are using your `mutex` to `Lock` before you append new items to your list and then `Unlock` again once the operation ends. As your server might handle multiple operations at the same time, this is a _very_ important step. If these operations try to access the same memory, you can run into a race-condition that might make Golang crash. To avoid this, you are using `mutex`, which is scoped to your package.

After `Add`, you will find the last two public functions. First, you will find `Delete`, which, as the name states, will remove an item from the `list`. Then, you will find `Complete`, which will mark a to-do item as complete (based on its `ID`) in your `list`.

Then, after the public functions, you will find the private functions of your package. For starter, you will find the `newTodo` function, which will take in a `msg` in the form of a `string` and return a new instance of the `Todo` struct. This instance will contain an `ID` (i.e., a UUID in the form of a string) and the `complete` flag set to false.

The next private function you will find is the `findTodoLocation` function. You will use this function to find the index location of a to-do item based on its `ID`. If no matches are found after iterating over all the items, this function will return an error saying that it couldn't find the desired item. Notice that you are using `mutex` again in this method. This time, you are using the `RLock` (Read Lock) function since you will only be reading from your list and not writing to it.

Right after the `findTodoLocation` function, you will see the `removeElementByLocation` function. In this function, you are setting your `list` variable to a new array, which contains all elements from the previous `list` up to a given location, appended with all elements after (but not including) the same given location. This means that, by giving a specific location to this function, you will get a new list without that given location (essentially deleting it from the previous list).

Then, the very last function in your store package is `setTodoCompleteByLocation`. Just like your remove function, this function takes in a location in the form of an integer. However, this function is much less complex and simply sets the `Complete` property of the item found on the given location to true.

Lastly, if you take a close look at the source code of this package, you will notice that it is using a third-party package called `xid` for generating UUIDs (Universally Unique Identifiers). As such, you will need to obtain this package before compiling your application. To do so, you will have to run the following command:

```bash
go get github.com/rs/xid
```

### Building the Golang Web Server and Serving Static Files

Right on! Now is the time to develop a web server with Golang and Gin. So, for starters, you will need to grab Gin from the internet. To do this, run the following code:

```bash
go get github.com/gin-gonic/gin
```

Great. Now, in your project root (`./`), you will create a file called `main.go` and insert the following code into it:

```go
package main

func main() {
	r := gin.Default()
	r.NoRoute(func(c *gin.Context) {
		dir, file := path.Split(c.Request.RequestURI)
		ext := filepath.Ext(file)
		if file == "" || ext == "" {
			c.File("./ui/dist/ui/index.html")
		} else {
			c.File("./ui/dist/ui/" + path.Join(dir, file))
		}
	})

	r.GET("/todo", handlers.GetTodoListHandler)
	r.POST("/todo", handlers.AddTodoHandler)
	r.DELETE("/todo/:id", handlers.DeleteTodoHandler)
	r.PUT("/todo", handlers.CompleteTodoHandler)

	err := r.Run(":3000")
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
}
```

Compared to the package you built in the last section, this file is pretty straightforward. First, you create your Gin server using `gin.Default()`. This command will return an object that you can use to configure and run the web server.

Then, you do something that can be considered a little bit _hacky_. As you may know, routing in Gin is quite specific and cannot have ambiguous routes for the root path. Essentially, Gin will complain if you have a configuration like `/*` because this will interfere with every other route in your web server (those would never be called). In Node.js (and other popular web servers), you can do this because the path routing is determined by the most specific to the least specific configuration. So, in that case, a route like `/api/something` would have precedence over `/*`.

Unfortunately, this is not the case by default in Gin. However, to implement this in your server, you will take advantage of the `NoRoute` function, which matches all routes that have not been specified already. This route function will assume that this call is asking for a file and attempt to find this file.

If a client asks for the root path, or if the file is not found, you will serve them the `index.html`file (which will be produced from your Angular project at a later point). Otherwise, you will serve the file requested by the client.

> **Note:** There are other ways to do this and, depending on what you want to achieve, better ways to achieve that. However, for this tutorial, this will do just fine. 

Now, after this generic endpoint, you are adding routes to fetch the data from your to-do list. They are all pointing to the same path '/todo', but they all use different HTTP methods:

- `GET`: This endpoint enables users to retrieve the entire to-do list.
- `POST`: This endpoint enables users to add new items to the list.
- `DELETE`: This endpoint enables users to delete a to-do from the list based on an `ID`. 
- `PUT`: This endpoint enables users to change a to-do item from incomplete to complete.

Each one of these endpoints is structured in the same manner (i.e., `r.<METHOD>(<PATH>, <Gin function>)`. Your Gin function is basically any function that takes the parameter of a `gin.Context` pointer. If you look at the `NoRoute` function, you will see an example of an anonymous function with the input of a `gin.Context` pointer.

Lastly, the `main.go` script runs your web server on port `3000` and `panic` if an error occurs while running the web server.

In the next section, you will learn how to develop the handlers that will manage the incoming HTTP requests.

### Developing the API Endpoints with Gin Handlers

To handle the incoming HTTP requests, in this section, you will learn how to develop Gin handlers. To begin with, you will create a new directory called `handlers` in the project root. Then, inside this directory, you will create a file called `handlers.go`. In this file, you will write the code necessary to handle all methods (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`,  and `DELETE`) available in your API endpoints (`/todo`).

Since you already implemented most of the functionality necessary in the `todo` package, this will be a relatively simple exercise. The final code in the `handlers.go` file will look as such:

```go
package handlers

import (
	"encoding/json"
	"io"
	"io/ioutil"
	"net/http"

	"github.com/<YOUR_GITHUB_USER>/golang-auth0-example/todo"
	"github.com/gin-gonic/gin"
)

// GetTodoListHandler returns all current todo items
func GetTodoListHandler(c *gin.Context) {
	c.JSON(http.StatusOK, todo.Get())
}

// AddTodoHandler adds a new todo to the todo list
func AddTodoHandler(c *gin.Context) {
	todoItem, statusCode, err := convertHTTPBodyToTodo(c.Request.Body)
	if err != nil {
		c.JSON(statusCode, err)
		return
	}
	c.JSON(statusCode, gin.H{"id": todo.Add(todoItem.Message)})
}

// DeleteTodoHandler will delete a specified todo based on user http input
func DeleteTodoHandler(c *gin.Context) {
	todoID := c.Param("id")
	if err := todo.Delete(todoID); err != nil {
		c.JSON(http.StatusInternalServerError, err)
		return
	}
	c.JSON(http.StatusOK, "")
}

// CompleteTodoHandler will complete a specified todo based on user http input
func CompleteTodoHandler(c *gin.Context) {
	todoItem, statusCode, err := convertHTTPBodyToTodo(c.Request.Body)
	if err != nil {
		c.JSON(statusCode, err)
		return
	}
	if todo.Complete(todoItem.ID) != nil {
		c.JSON(http.StatusInternalServerError, err)
		return
	}
	c.JSON(http.StatusOK, "")
}

func convertHTTPBodyToTodo(httpBody io.ReadCloser) (todo.Todo, int, error) {
	body, err := ioutil.ReadAll(httpBody)
	if err != nil {
		return todo.Todo{}, http.StatusInternalServerError, err
	}
	defer httpBody.Close()
	return convertJSONBodyToTodo(body)
}

func convertJSONBodyToTodo(jsonBody []byte) (todo.Todo, int, error) {
	var todoItem todo.Todo
	err := json.Unmarshal(jsonBody, &todoItem)
	if err != nil {
		return todo.Todo{}, http.StatusBadRequest, err
	}
	return todoItem, http.StatusOK, nil
}
```

> **Note:** You will have to replace `<YOUR_GITHUB_USER>` in the code above with your own GitHub username.

As mentioned earlier, all of your handler functions take a pointer to `gin.Context` as a parameter. This parameter essentially contains the `http.Request` reader and an `http.ResponseWriter` writer. Besides these functionalities that allow you to read from the request and to write a response, this pointer contains a lot of metadata about the request.

Basically speaking, this code is structured as follows:

1. Grab input and convert if necessary.
2. Check for errors.
3. Perform operation.
4. Return `error` or the `ok` status.

At the bottom of the code, you will notice two helper functions specifically tailored to parse input. The `convertHTTPBodyToTodo` function will read the body from the request and return it as a `Todo` object. This is done by using the `ioutil.ReadAll` which will read all bytes from an `io.Reader` stream. Once this function reads all bytes, you use `convertJSONBodyToTodo` to convert them from JSON (which is the original format of the request body) to a `Todo` object.

With these convert operations encapsulated in their functions, it's pretty easy to keep your handlers logic simple and neat. The only other thing that might be worth mentioning the usage of the `c.JSON` function. You are using this function to convert the response into JSON objects before sending them to your users.

After these changes, you are ready to run your Golang API. So, go to your project root and issue the following command:

```bash
go run main.go
```

This will make your server start listening requests on `localhost:3000`. To test it, you can then use a command-line tool like `curl` or a graphical solution like [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/). Using `curl`, you can test your application like this:

```bash
# add a new to-do item
curl localhost:3000/todo -d '{"message": "finish writing the article"}'

# get all to-do items
curl localhost:3000/todo
```

![Running your Golang backend API](https://cdn.auth0.com/blog/golang-angular/running-golang-backend-api.png)

### Securing the Golang API with Auth0

That's awesome. You now have a Golang backend API up and running. Time to celebrate? Not quite yet... you have one big issue. Right now, anyone can issue requests to your API. That's not ideal. You probably want to make sure that only people that you trust can access and edit your to-do list. To do this, you will use [Auth0 as the Identity and Access Management (IAM) system](https://auth0.com/learn/cloud-identity-access-management/) of your service.

If you don't have an Auth0 account yet, you can <a href="https://auth0.com/signup" data-amp-replace="CLIENT_ID" data-amp-addparams="anonId=CLIENT_ID(cid-scope-cookie-fallback-name)">sign up for a free one here</a>.

After signing up for Auth0, you will have to go to your [Auth0 dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com/) and proceed as follows:

1. go to [the _APIs_ section](https://manage.auth0.com/#/apis);
2. click on _Create API_;
3. define a _Name_ for your API (e.g., "Golang API");
4. define an _Identifier_ for it (e.g., `https://my-golang-api`);
5. and click on the _Create_ button (leave the _Signing Algorithm_ with RS256).

![Creating an Auth0 API to represent a Golang backend](https://cdn.auth0.com/blog/golang-angular/creating-an-auth0-api.png)

In a second or two, Auth0 will redirect you to your new Auth0 API. For this article, you won't have to change any other configuration on Auth0's dashboard. However, you can leave it open as you will have to copy a few values from it soon.

So, back in your code, you will want to refactor your API to check if the requests arriving have [access tokens](https://auth0.com/docs/tokens/access-token) issued by Auth0. To do this, open your `main.go` file and replace its code with this:

```go
package main

import (
	"log"
	"net/http"
	"os"
	"path"
	"path/filepath"

	"github.com/auth0-community/go-auth0"
	"github.com/gin-gonic/gin"
	jose "gopkg.in/square/go-jose.v2"

	"github.com/<YOUR_GITHUB_USER>/golang-auth0-example/handlers"
)

var (
	audience string
	domain   string
)

func main() {
	setAuth0Variables()
	r := gin.Default()

	// This will ensure that the angular files are served correctly
	r.NoRoute(func(c *gin.Context) {
		dir, file := path.Split(c.Request.RequestURI)
		ext := filepath.Ext(file)
		if file == "" || ext == "" {
			c.File("./ui/dist/ui/index.html")
		} else {
			c.File("./ui/dist/ui/" + path.Join(dir, file))
		}
	})

	authorized := r.Group("/")
	authorized.Use(authRequired())
	authorized.GET("/todo", handlers.GetTodoListHandler)
	authorized.POST("/todo", handlers.AddTodoHandler)
	authorized.DELETE("/todo/:id", handlers.DeleteTodoHandler)
	authorized.PUT("/todo", handlers.CompleteTodoHandler)

	err := r.Run(":3000")
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
}

func setAuth0Variables() {
	audience = os.Getenv("AUTH0_API_IDENTIFIER")
	domain = os.Getenv("AUTH0_DOMAIN")
}

// ValidateRequest will verify that a token received from an http request
// is valid and signyed by Auth0
func authRequired() gin.HandlerFunc {
	return func(c *gin.Context) {

		var auth0Domain = "https://" + domain + "/"
		client := auth0.NewJWKClient(auth0.JWKClientOptions{URI: auth0Domain + ".well-known/jwks.json"}, nil)
		configuration := auth0.NewConfiguration(client, []string{audience}, auth0Domain, jose.RS256)
		validator := auth0.NewValidator(configuration, nil)

		_, err := validator.ValidateRequest(c.Request)

		if err != nil {
			log.Println(err)
			terminateWithError(http.StatusUnauthorized, "token is not valid", c)
			return
		}
		c.Next()
	}
}

func terminateWithError(statusCode int, message string, c *gin.Context) {
	c.JSON(statusCode, gin.H{"error": message})
	c.Abort()

If you analyze the new version of this code carefully, you will notice that you added a routing group (called `authorized`) to secure all endpoints in your backend. That is, by calling `authorized.Use(authRequired())` and putting all endpoint definitions inside the `authorized` routing group, you are telling Gin that all requests made to these endpoints must be evaluated by the `authRequired` function first.

Another change in this code is the addition of two new global variables: `audience` and `domain`. You need these variables so you can validate access tokens against Auth0. As you can see, these variables will be retrieved from your environment variables on start, using the `setAuth0Variables` function. You will set them with your Auth0 values before running your backend again.

As the core piece of validation is the `authRequired` function, a better explanation about it is required. The `authRequired` function is what is known as a middleware function. In Gin terms, a middleware must return a `gin.HandlerFunc` function that contains a call to `Next()` in the body. Basically, your function validates a token, which is found in the `Authorization` header of the incoming request. The middleware does this by using JWKS (JSON Web Key Set). Essentially, [JWKS is a method for verifying JWT, using a public/private key infrastructure](https://auth0.com/docs/jwks).

Luckily for you, using Auth0's Golang library makes this process extremely simple. All you have to do is to write a few lines of code to validate the incoming token. If this results in an error, you terminate the current connection, responding to it with an `http.StatusUnauthorized` (401) status. If the token is valid, then you send the request onto the next function (by calling `Next()`) in the handler chain.

Before wrapping up, you still need to install the two new libraries that this code is now using:

```bash
go get github.com/auth0-community/go-auth0 gopkg.in/square/go-jose.v2
```

{% include tweet_quote.html quote_text="Securing a @golang backend API with @auth0 is really, really simple." %}

That's it. Securing a Golang backend API with Auth0 is as simple as that. To see this in action, hit `Ctrl` + `c` to stop the previously running instance of your API and then run it again:

```bash
# set env variables
export AUTH0_API_IDENTIFIER=<YOUR_AUTH0_API>
export AUTH0_DOMAIN=<YOUR_AUTH0_TENANT>.auth0.com

go run main.go
```

> **Note:** You have to replace `<YOUR_AUTH0_API>` with the identifier you set in your Auth0 API while creating it. Also, you have to replace `<YOUR_AUTH0_TENANT>` with the subdomain you chose while creating your Auth0 account.

Now, if you try to issue a request to your API without sending an access token retrieved from Auth0:

```bash
curl GET localhost:3000/todo
```

You will get a nice error sent back:

```json
{
  "error":"token is not valid"
}
```

To fetch a temporary access token to validate that your server still works, you can go to the _Test_ section of your Auth0 API and copy the `curl` command shown there.

![Auth0 showing a curl command to generate access tokens.](https://cdn.auth0.com/blog/golang-angular/fetching-an-access-token-with-auth0.png)

Executing this `curl` command will make Auth0 generate an access token that you can use to communicate with your backend API.

To facilitate issuing requests to your backend, you can copy the access token generated and save it in an environment variable:

```bash
ACCESS_TOKEN="eyJ0eX...WXaTRg"
```

After that, you can issue authenticated requests like this:

```bash
# authenticated req to add a new to-do item
curl -H 'Authorization: Bearer '$ACCESS_TOKEN localhost:3000/todo -d '{"message": "finish writing the article"}'

# authenticated req to get all to-do items
curl -H 'Authorization: Bearer '$ACCESS_TOKEN localhost:3000/todo
```

## Conclusion and Next Steps

Done! You just finished developing a secure backend API with Golang, Gin, and Auth0. The application that you created was pretty simple, just a todo list where you can add, delete, and to-do items as complete. However, the framework around your application is quite sound. You handled authentication via Auth0, which creates a very strong starting point for your application (it is important to think about security and identity management from the start).

Adding features to your application now becomes a lot easier. Once you have established a strong fundament in security, you can add different to-do lists for different users. Using a third-party security solution like Auth0 is also a great advantage because you can rest assured that this solution will keep your users' personal data safe. With a few changes here and there (such as serving your API and static files over HTTPS), you can quite confidently deploy this code to production.

I hope the first part of this series has been helpful and that it has given some insight on how easy it is to implement Auth0 as a third-party authentication service on Golang. In the second part of this series, [The Front-end - Developing and Securing Angular Apps](https://auth0.com/blog/developing-golang-and-angular-apps-part-2-angular-front-end), you will learn how to implement the frontend client of your to-do list with Angular and how to integrate it with your Golang backend API.

Stay tuned!
