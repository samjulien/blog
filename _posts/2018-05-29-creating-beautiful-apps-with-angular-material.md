**TL;DR:** In this article, you will learn how to take advantage of Angular Material to create beautiful and modern Angular applications. You will start from scratch, installing Node.js and Angular CLI (in case you don't have them yet), then you will install and configure the dependencies needed to develop with Angular Material. You can find the final code developed throughout this article in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/auth0-blog/angular-material).

## So, What Exactly is Angular Material?

Angular Material is a third-party package used on Angular projects to facilitate the development process through reutilization of common components like Cards, beautiful Inputs, Data Tables, and so on. The list of available components is big and continues to grow as we speak. So, for a full reference of components with examples, check [the official website](https://material.angular.io/).

With Angular, the entire app is a composition of components and, instead of building and styling components from the group up, you can leverage with Angular Material which provides out-of-the-box styled components that follow the [Material Design Spec](https://material.io/guidelines/).

This specification is used by Google in the Android operating system and is also very popular on the web due to its beautiful UI utilities.

## Angular Material Tutorial

The idea of this is article is to teach you how to use Angular Material through a hands-on exercise. First, you will check the dependencies that you need on your computer to use and develop with Angular Material, then you will learn how to configure and use different components.

### Setup the Environment for Angular

To work with Angular, you will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Angular CLI (Command Line Interface)](https://cli.angular.io/) installed in your development environment. Node.js will provide the packages needed by the CLI to work and the development server so you can check your progress in real time.

Angular CLI is the tool that helps you create a new Angular project and configure Angular components, services, and so on. You will need it because an Angular project is more than just HTML and script files. That is, An angular project uses [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) which needs to be transpiled and optimized to run browsers. Without Angular CLI, you would need to setup and wire a lot of tools to work together, which would consume too much time.

If you don't have Node.js installed in your computer, proceed to [the download page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and follow the instructions there (or use a tool like [N, a Node.js version manager](https://github.com/tj/n) to have multiple versions installed with ease). Then, after installing Node.js, use NPM (which comes along with Node.js) to install Angular CLI:

```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

> **Note:** Depending on the setup of your computer, you might need to use `sudo` to use the `-g` (global) flag.

### Create an Angular Project

Having both Node.js and Angular CLI correctly installed on your computer, you can use the following command to set up a new Angular project:

```bash
# create a new Angular project under angular-material-tutorial
ng new angular-material-tutorial
```

This command will generate a directory/file (under a new directory called `angular-material-tutorial`) structure with a bunch of files that are needed so you can create your Angular applications. To learn the details of this structure, please, check [the Angular CLI documentation](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli).

To help you throughout this tutorial, you can set an environment variable to point to the root directory of your Angular project:

```bash
# create a variable to point to the root dir
ROOT_DIR=$(pwd)/angular-material-tutorial

# move into it
cd $ROOT_DIR
```

### Install Angular Material

To install Angular Material as a dependency of your project, run the following command:

```bash
npm install @angular/material @angular/cdk
```

For now, you won't make any changes to your project's source code. First, you will install a few more cool dependencies.

### Angular Material Theme

After installing Angular Material, you will configure a [theme](https://material.angular.io/guide/theming) that defines what colors will be used in your Angular Material components. To configure the basic theme, open the `src/styles.css` file and paste the following code in it:

```css
@import "~@angular/material/prebuilt-themes/indigo-pink.css";
```

By the way, if you don't know what IDE (Integrated Development Environment) to use while developing with Angular, [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a great (and free) alternative.

### Angular Material Gesture

Some components like [Slide Toggle](https://material.angular.io/components/slide-toggle/overview), [Slider](https://material.angular.io/components/slider/overview), and [Tooltip](https://material.angular.io/components/tooltip/overview) rely on a library called HammerJS to capture touch gestures. So, you will need to install HammerJS and load it into our application.

To do so, from the `$ROOT_DIR` directory, run:

```bash
npm install hammerjs
```

After installing it, add the following line at the top of the `src/main.ts` file:

```js
import 'hammerjs'; 
``` 

### Material Icons

Another cool thing to add to your project is the [Material Icons](https://material.io/icons/) library. To have access to this huge library of icons, update the `src/index.html` file as follows:

{% highlight html %}
{% raw %}
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <!-- ... other tags ... -->
  <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/icon?family=Material+Icons" rel="stylesheet">
</head>
<!-- ... body and app root ... -->
</html>
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

## What Will You Build with Angular Material

After setting up the Angular project structure and some dependencies, you will be able to start developing apps. In this article, to learn Angular Material through practical exercises, you will develop a dashboard for a blog engine where users will be able to insert new posts and delete existing ones. This won't be a full-fledged application with a backend persistence nor enhanced features. The idea here is to show how cool and easy it is to use Angular Material.

{% include tweet_quote.html quote_text="I'm learning Angular Material through practical exercises!" %}

### Importing Material Components

The first thing you will do is to create a new file called `material.module.ts` in the `./src/app` directory. Inside this file, you will add the following code:

```typescript
import {NgModule} from '@angular/core';

@NgModule({
  imports: [],
  exports: []
})
export class MaterialModule {}
```

The idea of creating a new Angular module (`@NgModule`) is to centralize what you will import from Angular Material in a single file. So, before adding Angular Material components in this file, you will need to import and configure it in your main module (i.e. in the `./src/app/app.module.ts` file) as follows:

```typescript
// ... other import statements ...
import {BrowserAnimationsModule} from '@angular/platform-browser/animations';
import {MaterialModule} from './material.module';

@NgModule({
  // ... declarations property ...
  imports: [
    BrowserModule,
    BrowserAnimationsModule,
    MaterialModule,
  ],
  // ... providers and bootstrap properties ...
})
export class AppModule {}
```

> **Note:** You are also adding `BrowserAnimationsModule` so your app can count on some cool animation features (like the shadow on the click of the buttons).

### Angular Material Sidenav

After defining a centralized place to import Angular Material components, you can focus on adding a navigation bar to your app. For this, you will update the `./src/app/material.module.ts` to look like this:

```typescript
import {NgModule} from '@angular/core';

import {
  MatSidenavModule,
  MatToolbarModule,
  MatIconModule,
  MatListModule,
} from '@angular/material';

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    MatSidenavModule,
    MatToolbarModule,
    MatIconModule,
    MatListModule,
  ],
  exports: [
    MatSidenavModule,
    MatToolbarModule,
    MatIconModule,
    MatListModule,
  ]
})
export class MaterialModule {}
```

This change will make `MatSidenavModule` available in your application. So, now, you can update the app template (`./src/app/app.component.html`) to use this component:

{% highlight html %}
{% raw %}
<mat-sidenav-container>
  <mat-sidenav  #sidenav role="navigation">
   <mat-nav-list>
    <a mat-list-item>
      <mat-icon class="icon">input</mat-icon>
      <span class="label">Login</span>
    </a>
    <a mat-list-item>
      <mat-icon class="icon">home</mat-icon>  
        <span class="label">Home</span>
    </a>
    <a mat-list-item>
      <mat-icon class="icon">dashboard</mat-icon>  
      <span class="label">Dashboard</span>
    </a>
    <a  mat-list-item type="button">
      <mat-icon class="icon">input</mat-icon>
      <span class="label">LogOut</span>
    </a>  
    </mat-nav-list>
  </mat-sidenav>
  <mat-sidenav-content>
    <mat-toolbar color="primary">
     <div fxHide.gt-xs>
       <button mat-icon-button>
        <mat-icon>menu</mat-icon>
      </button>
    </div>
     <div>
       <a>
          Material Blog
       </a>
     </div>
     <div fxFlex fxLayout fxLayoutAlign="flex-end"  fxHide.xs>
        <ul fxLayout fxLayoutGap="20px" class="navigation-items">
            <li>
                <a>
                  <mat-icon class="icon">input</mat-icon>
                  <span  class="label">Login</span>
                 </a>
            </li>
            <li>
              <a >
                  <mat-icon class="icon">home</mat-icon>
                  <span class="label">Home</span>
              </a>
            </li>
            <li>
                <a>
                    <mat-icon class="icon">dashboard</mat-icon>
                    <span class="label">Dashboard</span>
                </a>
              </li>
            <li>
                <a>
                  <mat-icon class="icon">input</mat-icon>
                  <span class="label">LogOut</span>
                 </a>
            </li>
        </ul>
     </div>
    </mat-toolbar>
    <main>
    </main>
  </mat-sidenav-content>
</mat-sidenav-container>
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

For now, you won't have anything nice to see in a browser yet, but you will get there soon.

### Angular Material and Flexbox

To make your life easier when defining the layout of your Angular application, you will take advantage of the Flex layout schema introduced recently on CSS. More specifically, you will use an Angular directive called `fxFlex` to handle the Flex layout.

To use it, install the Flex layout package with the following command:

```bash
npm install @angular/flex-layout rxjs-compat
```

> Note that after the major upgrade to Angular 6, you will need to install `rxjs-compat` alongside with `@angular/flex-layout`. The command above already include this library. So, it is just a matter of copying and pasting the command in your terminal (while being in the `@ROOT_DIR` set above, of course).

Then, import and configure it into `src/app.module.ts` as shown here:

```typescript
// ... other import statements ...
import {FlexLayoutModule} from '@angular/flex-layout';

@NgModule({
  // ... declarations property ...
  imports: [
    // ... other modules ...
    FlexLayoutModule,
  ],
  // ... providers and bootstrap properties ...
})
export class AppModule {}
```

If you take a close look, you will see that you are already using some features of this package in the navigation bar defined before. For example, you have added directives like `fxLayout`, `fxLayoutAlign`, and other `fxFlex` directives.

Before running your app for the first time, add the following CSS rules to `app.component.css` so your navigation looks a little bit better:

```css
mat-sidenav-container, mat-sidenav-content, mat-sidenav {
  height: 100%;
}

mat-sidenav {
  width: 250px;
}

a {
  text-decoration: none;
  color: white;
}

a:hover,
a:active {
  color: lightgray;
}

.navigation-items {
  list-style: none;
  padding: 0;
  margin: 0;
  cursor: pointer;
}

.icon {
  display: inline-block;
  height: 30px;
  margin: 0 auto;
  padding-right: 5px;
  text-align: center;
  vertical-align: middle;
  width: 15%;
}

.label {
  display: inline-block;
  line-height: 30px;
  margin: 0;
  width: 85%;
}
```

Also, add the following rule to `./src/styles.css` so you don't have any white margins on your app:

```css
@import "~@angular/material/prebuilt-themes/indigo-pink.css";

body {
  margin: 0;
}
```

With these rules in place, you can issue `ng serve` from your project root to check your application for the first time.

### More Angular Material Components

Now that you have your application up and running with your first Angular Material component, it's time to add more features. So, the first thing you will do is to define two new components (views) to your application, the `WelcomeComponent` and the `DashboardComponent`. To create this two new components, you can use the Angular CLI tool as follows:

```bash
ng g c welcome --module app.module
ng g c dashboard --module app.module
```

It's important to define `--module app.module` because you have another module called `material.module` which makes Angular CLI unable to identify the targeted module automatically.

After running these two commands, open the `welcome.component.html` and replace the code with this:

{% highlight html %}
{% raw %}
<div style="text-align:center">
  <h1>Angular Content Management System</h1>
  <p>
    This is a platform for technical writers to manage their blog post contents related to angular.
    <br> Click on Login to get Started!!!
  </p>
</div>
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

Don't worry about the `DashboardComponent` for now, you will work on it soon.

### Creating Routes

Now that you have multiple components, you will need to define some routes so your users can access them. To do so, you can create a file called `app.routes.ts` in the `./src/app` directory and add the following code to it:

```ts
import {NgModule} from '@angular/core';
import {RouterModule, Routes} from '@angular/router';
import {WelcomeComponent} from './welcome/welcome.component';
import {DashboardComponent} from './dashboard/dashboard.component';

const routes: Routes = [
  {path: '', component: WelcomeComponent},
  {path: 'dashboard', component: DashboardComponent}
];

@NgModule({
  imports: [RouterModule.forRoot(routes)],
  exports: [RouterModule]
})
export class AppRouters {}
```

In this file, you are defining two routes: one for the `WelcomeComponent` and one for the `DashboardComponent`. As such, when you head to [`http://localhost:4200`](http://localhost:4200) you will see the `WelcomeComponent` and when you head to [`http://localhost:4200/dashboard`](http://localhost:4200/dashboard), you will see the `DashboardComponent`.

Besides defining this module, you will need to update the `app.component.html` file to add links to these new routes:

{% highlight html %}
{% raw %}
<mat-sidenav-container>
  <mat-sidenav  #sidenav role="navigation">
   <mat-nav-list>
    <a mat-list-item>
      <mat-icon class="icon">input</mat-icon>
      <span class="label">Login</span>
    </a>
    <a mat-list-item
        routerLink="/">
      <mat-icon class="icon">home</mat-icon>  
        <span class="label">Home</span>
    </a>
    <a mat-list-item
      routerLink="/dashboard">
      <mat-icon class="icon">dashboard</mat-icon>  
      <span class="label">Dashboard</span>
    </a>
    <a  mat-list-item 
        type="button">
      <mat-icon class="icon">input</mat-icon>
      <span class="label">LogOut</span>
    </a>  
    </mat-nav-list>
  </mat-sidenav>
  <mat-sidenav-content>
    <mat-toolbar color="primary">
     <div fxHide.gt-xs>
       <button mat-icon-button (click)="sidenav.toggle()">
        <mat-icon>menu</mat-icon>
      </button>
    </div>
     <div>
       <a routerLink="/">
          Material Blog
       </a>
     </div>
     <div fxFlex fxLayout fxLayoutAlign="flex-end"  fxHide.xs>
        <ul fxLayout fxLayoutGap="20px" class="navigation-items">
            <li>
                <a>
                  <mat-icon class="icon">input</mat-icon>
                  <span  class="label">Login</span>
                 </a>
            </li>
            <li>
              <a
                routerLink="/">
                  <mat-icon class="icon">home</mat-icon>
                  <span class="label">Home</span>
              </a>
            </li>
            <li>
                <a
                  routerLink="/dashboard">
                    <mat-icon class="icon">dashboard</mat-icon>
                    <span class="label">Dashboard</span>
                </a>
              </li>
            <li>
                <a>
                  <mat-icon class="icon">input</mat-icon>
                  <span class="label">LogOut</span>
                 </a>
            </li>
        </ul>
     </div>
    </mat-toolbar>
    <main>
      <router-outlet></router-outlet>
    </main>
  </mat-sidenav-content>
</mat-sidenav-container>
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

Lastly, you We will need to update the `app.module.ts` file to make use of the new module:

```typescript
// ... other import statements ...
import {AppRouters} from './app.routes';

@NgModule({
  // ... declarations property ...
  imports: [
    // ... other imports ...
    AppRouters,
  ],
  // ... providers and bootstrap properties ...
})
export class AppModule {}
```

If you check your application now (through `ng serve`), you will be able to see the contents defined in the HTML file of `WelcomeComponent`. Also, if you click on the _Dashboard_ link, you will see that it loads the "dashboard works!" message.

### Managing Data - Part 1

As your dashboard component has nothing more than a simple message, it's time to focus on enhancing it. The idea of this dashboard is to let users add and remove blog posts. As such, the first thing you will do it to define an interface to represent instances of blog posts.

To do so, create a new file called `Post.ts` inside the `./src/app` directory and add the following code to it:

```ts
export interface Post {
  title: string;
  category: string;
  date_posted: Date;
  position: number;
  body: string;
}
```

Now, you can use this interface to build a data service to simulate a real application. To create this service, you can run the following command:

```bash
ng g s data/data --module app.module
```

Once finished, you can open the `data.service.ts` file created and replace its code with:

```ts
import {Injectable} from '@angular/core';
import {Post} from '../Post';
import {Observable} from 'rxjs/Observable';
import 'rxjs/add/observable/of';

@Injectable()
export class DataService {

  ELEMENT_DATA: Post[] = [
    {position: 0, title: 'Post One', category: 'Web Development', date_posted: new Date(), body: 'Body 1'},
    {position: 1, title: 'Post Two', category: 'Android Development', date_posted: new Date(), body: 'Body 2'},
    {position: 2, title: 'Post Three', category: 'IOS Development', date_posted: new Date(), body: 'Body 3'},
    {position: 3, title: 'Post Four', category: 'Android Development', date_posted: new Date(), body: 'Body 4'},
    {position: 4, title: 'Post Five', category: 'IOS Development', date_posted: new Date(), body: 'Body 5'},
    {position: 5, title: 'Post Six', category: 'Web Development', date_posted: new Date(), body: 'Body 6'},
  ];
  categories = [
    {value: 'Web-Development', viewValue: 'Web Development'},
    {value: 'Android-Development', viewValue: 'Android Development'},
    {value: 'IOS-Development', viewValue: 'IOS Development'}
  ];

  constructor() {
  }

  getData(): Observable<Post[]> {
    return Observable.of<Post[]>(this.ELEMENT_DATA);
  }

  getCategories() {
    return this.categories;
  }

  addPost(data) {
    this.ELEMENT_DATA.push(data);
  }

  deletePost(index) {
    this.ELEMENT_DATA = [...this.ELEMENT_DATA.slice(0, index), ...this.ELEMENT_DATA.slice(index + 1)];
  }

  dataLength() {
    return this.ELEMENT_DATA.length;
  }
}
```

In your data service, you have two different arrays: one for storing categories of posts and the other one for storing blog posts.

You will also have to guarantee that the `app.module.ts` file includes your new `DataService` class in its `providers` property:

```ts
// ... other imports ...
import {DataService} from './data/data.service';

@NgModule({
  // ... declarations and imports ...
  providers: [DataService],
  // ... bootstrap ...
})
export class AppModule { }
```

Now, you can update your dashboard to make use of the data service to render some data. So, open the `dashboard.component.ts` file and replace its code with this:

```ts
import {Component} from '@angular/core';
import {DataService} from '../data/data.service';
import {Post} from '../Post';
import {DataSource} from '@angular/cdk/table';
import {Observable} from 'rxjs/Observable';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-dashboard',
  templateUrl: './dashboard.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./dashboard.component.css']
})
export class DashboardComponent {
  constructor(private dataService: DataService) {
  }

  displayedColumns = ['date_posted', 'title', 'category', 'delete'];
  dataSource = new PostDataSource(this.dataService);
}

export class PostDataSource extends DataSource<any> {
  constructor(private dataService: DataService) {
    super();
  }

  connect(): Observable<Post[]> {
    return this.dataService.getData();
  }

  disconnect() {
  }
}
```

Then, open the `dashboard.component.html` file and replace everything with:

{% highlight html %}
{% raw %}
<div>
  <br>
    <div class="container">
        <div class="container">
          <div  fxLayout="column" fxLayout="column" fxLayoutGap="20px" fxLayout.gt-md="row"  fxLayoutAlign="space-around center" class="content">
              <div class="blocks" >
                  <button button="submit" mat-raised-button color="primary">
                      <mat-icon>add</mat-icon> Add Post
                  </button>
              </div>
        </div>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="container">
      <div fxLayout="row" fxLayoutAlign="center center" class="content">
        <mat-card class="card" >
          <mat-card-title fxLayout.gt-xs="row" fxLayout.xs="column">
            <h3>Recent Posts</h3>
          </mat-card-title>
          <mat-card-content>
              <div class="example-container mat-elevation-z8">
                  <mat-table #table [dataSource]="dataSource">

                    <mat-header-cell *matHeaderCellDef> Date Posted </mat-header-cell>
                    <mat-cell *matCellDef="let element"> {{element.date_posted  | date: 'd/M/y'}} </mat-cell>
                  </ng-container>
                    <ng-container matColumnDef="title">
                      <mat-header-cell *matHeaderCellDef> Title </mat-header-cell>
                      <mat-cell *matCellDef="let element"> {{element.title}} </mat-cell>
                    </ng-container>
                    <ng-container matColumnDef="category">
                      <mat-header-cell *matHeaderCellDef> Category </mat-header-cell>
                      <mat-cell *matCellDef="let element"> {{element.category}} </mat-cell>

                    <ng-container matColumnDef="delete">
                      <mat-header-cell *matHeaderCellDef></mat-header-cell>
                      <mat-cell *matCellDef="let element">
                        <a
                            type="button">
                          <mat-icon class="icon">delete</mat-icon>
                        </a> 
                      </mat-cell>
                    </ng-container>   
                    <mat-header-row *matHeaderRowDef="displayedColumns"></mat-header-row>
                    <mat-row *matRowDef="let row; columns: displayedColumns;"></mat-row>
                  </mat-table>
                </div> 
          </mat-card-content>
        </mat-card>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

Here, you are using some Angular Material Components like `mat-card`, `mat-button`, and `mat-table` to render the list of existing blog posts. Before proceeding, you will have to import these components into the `material.module.ts` file. So, open it and update as follows:

```typescript
import {NgModule} from '@angular/core';

import {
  // ... other modules ...
  MatCardModule,
  MatButtonModule,
  MatTableModule,
} from '@angular/material';

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    // ... other modules ...
    MatCardModule,
    MatButtonModule,
    MatTableModule,
  ],
  exports: [
    // ... other modules ...
    MatCardModule,
    MatButtonModule,
    MatTableModule,
  ]
})
export class MaterialModule {}
```

Now, before checking your application running with these new components, open the `dashboard.component.css` file and add the following content to it:

```css 
.card {
  min-width: 80%;
}

.example-container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  max-height: 500px;
  min-width: 100%;
}
  
.mat-table {
  overflow: auto;
  max-height: 500px;
}

a {
  cursor: pointer;
}
```

Now, running your app (`ng serve`) and heading to [`http://localhost:4200/bashboard`](http://localhost:4200/bashboard), you will see the following screen:

![Angular Material dashboard](https://cdn.auth0.com/blog/angular-material/dashboard.png)

## Securing Angular Material with Auth0

As you don't want unauthenticated users to create blog posts nor you want them to remove existing ones, you will take advantage of [Auth0](https://auth0.com) to easily secure your app.

So, before integrating Auth0 into your app, you will need to <a href="https://auth0.com/signup" data-amp-replace="CLIENT_ID" data-amp-addparams="anonId=CLIENT_ID(cid-scope-cookie-fallback-name)">sign up for a free Auth0 account</a>. After following the instructions there to create your account, you will need to create an [Auth0 Application](https://auth0.com/docs/applications) to represent your Angular app.

To do so, click on the `New Application` button on your dashboard page. Then, fill the form shown as follows:

- _Application Name:_ Angular Material Tutorial
- _Application Type:_ Single Page Web Apps

Once finished, Auth0 will show you a screen where you can see tabs like _Quick Start_, _Settings_, and _Addons_. Choose the _Settings_ tab and add `http://localhost:4200/` as a _Allowed Callback URL_. This is the URL that Auth0 is allowed to call after finishing the authentication process (this configuration exists to make the process more secure).

Now, create a new file called `auth.service.ts` in the `./src/app` directory and add the following code to it:
 
```ts
import {Injectable} from '@angular/core';
import {Router} from '@angular/router';
import * as auth0 from 'auth0-js';

@Injectable()
export class AuthService {

  auth0 = new auth0.WebAuth({
    clientID: '<APPLICATION_CLIENT_ID>',
    domain: '<YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN>',
    responseType: 'token id_token',
    redirectUri: 'http://localhost:4200/',
    scope: 'openid'
  });

  constructor(public router: Router) {
  }

  public login(): void {
    this.auth0.authorize();
  }

  public handleAuthentication(): void {
    this.auth0.parseHash((err, authResult) => {
      if (authResult && authResult.accessToken && authResult.idToken) {
        window.location.hash = '';
        this.setSession(authResult);
        this.router.navigate(['/dashboard']);
      } else if (err) {
        this.router.navigate(['/']);
        console.log(err);
      }
    });
  }

  private setSession(authResult): void {
    // Set the time that the Access Token will expire at
    const expiresAt = JSON.stringify((authResult.expiresIn * 1000) + new Date().getTime());
    localStorage.setItem('access_token', authResult.accessToken);
    localStorage.setItem('id_token', authResult.idToken);
    localStorage.setItem('expires_at', expiresAt);
  }

  public logout(): void {
    // Remove tokens and expiry time from localStorage
    localStorage.removeItem('access_token');
    localStorage.removeItem('id_token');
    localStorage.removeItem('expires_at');
    // Go back to the home route
    this.router.navigate(['/']);
  }

  public isAuthenticated(): boolean {
    // Check whether the current time is past the
    // Access Token's expiry time
    const expiresAt = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('expires_at'));
    return new Date().getTime() < expiresAt;
  }
}
```

The code in this service, although lengthy, is quite simple. You are just defining an instance of `auth0.WebAuth` to interact with Auth0 and then you are defining a method called `handleAuthentication` that will fetch the tokens returned back by Auth0. Also, there are other handy methods in this service like `isAuthenticated`, `login`, and `logout`. You will use all of them soon.

> **Important!** You will need to replace `<APPLICATION_CLIENT_ID>` and `<YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN>` in the code with the values from your Auth0 application. For example, the client id will look like `lU4PgkBaogkZP13Mv1gSkHK6VIH6xIkq` and the domain will look like `bk-tmp.auth0.com`.

Also, before proceeding, you will have to install [the `auth0-js` library](https://github.com/auth0/auth0.js):

```bash
npm install auth0-js
```

Now, you can update the `app.component.html` to integrate it with your new service:

{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

In the new version of this file, you are using the methods defined in the service created before to show or hide the login and logout buttons.

Now, you will need to import `AuthService` in the `AppComponent` class and make it fetch the token returned by Auth0. So, open the `app.component.ts` file and replace its contents with this:

```ts
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { AuthService } from './auth.service';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  templateUrl: './app.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./app.component.css']
})
export class AppComponent {
  constructor(public auth: AuthService) {
    auth.handleAuthentication();
  }
}
```

Lastly, you will need to update the `app.module.ts` file as follows:

```typescript
// ... other import statements ...
import {AuthService} from './auth.service';

@NgModule({
  // ... declarations and imports properties ...
  providers: [DataService, AuthService],
  // ... bootstrap property ...
})
export class AppModule {}
```

Running your application now, you will be able to log in through Auth0. After logging in, you will see that you are redirected to the dashboard and that the _Logout_ button is shown.

### Enabling Data Deletion

Now that your app is secured with Auth0, you will want to allow authenticated users to delete blog posts.
To do so, you will inject `AuthService` in your `DashboardComponent` class and define a new method called `deletePost` as follows:

```ts
// ... import statements ...
import {AuthService} from '../auth.service';

// ... @Component ...
export class DashboardComponent {
  constructor(private dataService: DataService, public auth: AuthService) {
  }

  // ... displayedColumns and dataSource ...

  deletePost(id) {
    if (this.auth.isAuthenticated()) {
      this.dataService.deletePost(id);
      this.dataSource = new PostDataSource(this.dataService);
    } else {
      alert('Login in Before');
    }
  }
}

// ... PostDataSource ...
```

Now, you just have to update the `dashboard.component.html` file to bind the click event of the `delete` button to the `deletePost` method:

{% highlight html %}
{% raw %}
<a (click)="deletePost(element.position)" type="button">
  <mat-icon class="icon">delete</mat-icon>
</a>
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

### Enabling Data Input

In the last feature of your app, you will use the dialog component of the Angular Material library to allow users to insert new blog posts. As you want only authenticated users to access this feature and you want to let unauthenticated users that they must log in before adding blog posts, you add the `*ngIf="auth.isAuthenticated()"` directive to wrap the _Add Post_ button. So, open the `dashboard.component.html` file and add this directive to the `div class="blocks"` element that wraps this button:

{% highlight html %}
{% raw %}
<div class="blocks" *ngIf="auth.isAuthenticated()">
  <button button="submit" mat-raised-button color="primary">
    <mat-icon>add</mat-icon> Add Post
  </button>
</div>
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

Now, right after this block, add the following one:

{% highlight html %}
{% raw %}
<div class="blocks">
  <a button mat-raised-button color="primary" (click)="auth.login()" *ngIf="!auth.isAuthenticated()">
    <mat-icon>input</mat-icon>Login to Add Post
  </a>
</div>
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

This will be enough to tell unauthenticated users to log in.

Now, to enable users to create new blog posts, you will create a new component called `PostDialogComponent`. To do so, issue:

```bash
ng g c post-dialog --module app.module
```

Then, open the `post-dialog-component.html` file and put the following HTML code inside it:

{% highlight html %}
{% raw %}
<h1 mat-dialog-title>{{data}}</h1>
<div mat-dialog-content>
  <form class="example-form" (ngSubmit)="onSubmit()">
    <mat-form-field>
      <input matInput placeholder="Post Title" type="text" required [(ngModel)]="blogPost.title" name="name">
    </mat-form-field>
    <mat-form-field>
      <textarea matInput placeholder="Post Body" required [(ngModel)]="blogPost.body" name="body"></textarea>
    </mat-form-field>
    <mat-form-field>
      <mat-select matInput placeholder="Post Category" required [(ngModel)]="blogPost.category" name="category">
        <mat-option *ngFor="let cat of categories" [value]="cat.value">
          {{ cat.viewValue }}
        </mat-option>
      </mat-select>
    </mat-form-field>
    <button mat-raised-button type="submit" color="primary">Save</button>
  </form>
</div>
<div mat-dialog-actions>
  <button mat-raised-button class="close" (click)="onNoClick()" color="warn">Cancel</button>
</div>
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

In the HTML file, you can see you are using `mat-dialog`, `mat-input`, and `mat-select` from the Angular Material library. So, as you can imagine, you will need to import them into your `material.module.ts` file:

```typescript
import {NgModule} from '@angular/core';

import {
  // ... other modules ...
  MatDialogModule,
  MatInputModule,
  MatSelectModule,
} from '@angular/material';

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    // ... other modules ...
    MatDialogModule,
    MatInputModule,
    MatSelectModule,
  ],
  exports: [
    // ... other modules ...
    MatDialogModule,
    MatInputModule,
    MatSelectModule,
  ]
})
export class MaterialModule {}
```

Besides updating this module, you will need to import and configure the `FormsModule` from `@angular/forms` in the main module. So, open the `app.module.ts` file and update it as follows:

```typescript
// ... other imports ...
import {FormsModule} from '@angular/forms';

@NgModule({
  // ... declarations property ...
  imports: [
    // ... other modules ...
    FormsModule,
  ],
  // ... providers and bootstrap ...
})
export class AppModule {}
```

Also, to make your dialog look nice, you can insert the following rules in the `post-dialog-component.css` file:

```css 
.example-form {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
}
  
.example-form > * {
    width: 100%;
}

.close{
    width: 100%;
}
```

Then, you can open the `post-dialog-component.ts` file and replace its code with the following; 

```ts 
import {Component, EventEmitter, Inject} from '@angular/core';
import {MAT_DIALOG_DATA, MatDialogRef} from '@angular/material';
import {DataService} from '../data/data.service';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-post-dialog',
  templateUrl: './post-dialog.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./post-dialog.component.css']
})
export class PostDialogComponent {
  blogPost = {
    title: '',
    body: '',
    category: '',
    position: 0,
    date_posted: new Date()
  };
  public event: EventEmitter<any> = new EventEmitter();

  constructor(
    public dialogRef: MatDialogRef<PostDialogComponent>,
    @Inject(MAT_DIALOG_DATA) public data: any,
    public dataService: DataService
  ) {
  }

  onNoClick(): void {
    this.dialogRef.close();
  }

  onSubmit(): void {
    this.blogPost.position = this.dataService.dataLength();
    this.event.emit({data: this.blogPost});
    this.dialogRef.close();
  }

  categories = this.dataService.getCategories();
}
```

To make a button open up this dialog box, you need to tell it to do so by binding a click event to the button. So, open the `dashboard.component.html` and modify the button you created before to look like this:

```ts
<div class="blocks" *ngIf="auth.isAuthenticated()">
  <button button="submit" mat-raised-button color="primary" (click)="openDialog()">
    <mat-icon>add</mat-icon> Add Post
  </button>
</div>
```

Then, in the TypeScript file of the `dashboard.component`, you will have update the code as:

```ts 
// ... other import statements ...
import {PostDialogComponent} from '../post-dialog/post-dialog.component';
import {MatDialog} from '@angular/material';

// ... @Component ...
export class DashboardComponent {
  constructor(public auth: AuthService, public dialog: MatDialog, private dataService: DataService) {
  }
  // ... displayedColumns, dataSource, and deletePost ...

  openDialog(): void {
    let dialogRef = this.dialog.open(PostDialogComponent, {
      width: '600px',
      data: 'Add Post'
    });
    dialogRef.componentInstance.event.subscribe((result) => {
      this.dataService.addPost(result.data);
      this.dataSource = new PostDataSource(this.dataService);
    });
  }
}

// ... PostDataSource ...
```

Lastly, open the `./src/app/app.module.ts` file and add the following property to `@NgModule`:

```typescript
entryComponents: [
  PostDialogComponent
],
```

Now, to see the dialog in action, run `ng serve`, login, and head to [`http://localhost:4200/dashboard`](http://localhost:4200/dashboard). From there, hit the _Add Post_ button and you will see the following screen:
